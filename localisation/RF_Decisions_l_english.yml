#Revolutionary Anarchist
anarchist_stability:0 "Arrange Communal Debates"
anarchist_stability_desc:0 "Healthy argument on the tenets of leftism and the best way forward fosters understanding, uniting our communes under the umbrella of anarchy."

anarchist_popularity:0 "Democratise Institutions"
anarchist_popularity_desc:0 "A happy worker's voice matters. Ensuring every establishment is controlled by the community instead of some ex-capitalist or commissar is sure to satiate the people."

anarchist_war_support:0 "Local Militia Elections"

libertarian_popularity:0 "Integrate Trade Unions"
libertarian_popularity_desc:0 "Trade unions are the seeds of Marxism. When the socialist state walks in lockstep alongside its trade unions, it can never fall."

social_popularity_desc:0 "For some reason, capitalists always seem to have palpitations when dealing with social democrats, mistaking us for the communists! We must assure them that we won't seize the fruits of their hard labour."

social_war_support:0 "Work with Trade Unions"

liberal_war_support:0 "Stockpile Resources for War"
liberal_war_support_desc:0 "Loathe as we often are to admit it, war is good for the market. An increase in production now will leave us far stronger later."

#Despotic
despotic_stability:0 "The Great Speech"
despotic_stability_desc:0 "Words have power. The words of our glorious leader have the most power. A great speech in a common square is cathartic, unveiling and cleansing all social ills."

despotic_popularity:0 "Reward Loyal Subjects"
despotic_popularity_desc:0 "While loyalty to land and state is its own reward, adding material benefits tempts the less convinced."

reactionism_popularity:0 "Bully Rival Parties"
reactionism_popularity_desc:0 "Other parties are decadent: too attached to the decaying world, too obsessed with the superficial. They should be crushed under our heels, for we are the only sane option."

reactionism_war_support:0 "Inspire Ideological Militarism"
reactionism_war_support_desc:0 "We fight wars on two levels: one with our guns against our enemies, and one with our tongues against modernity. A corps unequipped to think about the conditions we leave in and acts disconnected from the valiance of a previous era is deficient. Someone who talks and theorises but never bothers to get up and do something in real life is deficient. We must raise ideal soldiers with deological perfection."

#Accelerationism
accelerationism_stability:0 "Align Arts and Academia"
accelerationism_stability_desc:0 "They're too just slow. Prissy scholars, lipstick and dresses, same fucking books, sports, movies. If we put a hundred bullets in their mushy brains, deafening them with our euphony, they're gone. We'll put in a quick lit. Everyone will love it."

accelerationism_popularity:0 "Promise a Liberating Alternative"
accelerationism_popularity_desc:0 "Even the Romans knew it! Without futurism, you will not be anything. The old laws keep you down: we'll set you free. Cast your traditions into the sea."

accelerationism_war_support:0 "Demand Absolute Fanaticism"
accelerationism_war_support_desc:0 "Of course you love us. Of course you do. Of course you love me. Of course you do. Dash yourself on the floor. Say you love me. Call out, scream it, scream it. Cry for me, beg for me, beg for the party, beg for it. Leave yourself open, exposed to a thousand theories. Let those flows run through you."
