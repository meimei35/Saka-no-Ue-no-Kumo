#EVENTS#
asy.1.title:0 "It Was Night"
asy.1.desc:0 "In the darkest night that a Middle-Easterner mountain nation could have, specifically in the historical center of Hakkari, therein sat the young, yet ancient, Nation's leader; His Holiness Mar Shimun XIX Benyamin, Patriarch of the Assyrian Church of the East, a religious man devoted to his Church and Nation his whole life, narrowly escaping death from Kurdish nationalists in the south and by Turkish revanchists in the north - he had always been in the edge of death and life. Now, at 59, he looked outside the local Government building, functioning from an old Assyrian church within city ruins, drinking some black tea - even if the time was not right, Benyamin felt like he wouldn't be able to taste it next morning. And so, as he looked at the great Moon in the cold night, the Son of Man came down unto the Heavens in two natures, clouds descending from the Night sky and slowly, gently revealing his hands which showed the two wounds of Christ. In His veils, Benyamin was placed, and slowly brought out of the patio he was in, and so like that, nothing else mattered. The bliss felt at the edge of life as he reached Heaven's Gate was unparallaled, and so he opened his eyes, as he reached for Heaven. He could not even hear anything with the exception of wonderful angelical singing from the great Cherubs of the skies, which from their ancient thrones unto the gate of Heaven sung for His Holiness Benyamin to come forward and join them in God's Kingdom."
asy.1.a:0 "\"Your Holiness, are you alright?\""
asy.2.title:0 "After the Quiet, therein came Violence"
asy.2.desc:0 "His Holiness' Mar Shimun XIX Benyamin passed away peacefully, and so with him went away any sense of stability in Assyria. Kurdish nationalists, Russian soldiers, Turkish Turanists, Assyrian Theocrats and Democrats, all battle out for control of power in our small fledging nation. Subsequently, it all came to a head today as various forces attempted a raid on the Provisional Government of Assyria led by Shimun XXI Eshai, resulting in a near state of Civil War where all of Assyria is participating. So, as the country sits on a knife's edge, who will gain the great push?"
asy.2.a:0 "The Assyrian Church of the East's militias repel the raids!"
asy.2.b:0 "Democrats within the provisional government stage a Coup and end the war!"
asy.2.c:0 "The Russian veterans are victorious!"
asy.3.title:0 "Ancient Traditions"
asy.3.desc:0 "\"And so, with the passing of one to the Kingdom of Heaven, comes another to represent Assyria in it's greatest time of need,\" said Shimun XXI Eshai, slowly sitting down on the Assyrian Church of the East's temporary temporal throne, seeking to express his desire to maintain Benyamin's calls for unity of the Assyrian national idea, and maintain their traditions and lifestyles. Subsequently, various anxious, yet relieved religious figures hailing from Russia to the United States have arrived to the convention, showing great solidarity among the Assyrian diaspora and local communities. And so, as Shimun XXI Eshai sat down on the throne, he was given the Temporal Scepter of the Assyrian Church of the East, alongside the needed clothes. And as he gave a silent prayer to everyone in the room, and more widely, everyone in Hakkari (this was the first radio-broadcasted event in much of Hakkari), he was given the title of His Holiness."
asy.3.a:0 "Welcome, Your Holiness."
asy.4.title:0 "Temporary Martial Law"
asy.4.desc:0 "Betrayal! Within the ranks of soldiers, many idealized a great shining democracy in Assyria, free from the tyranny of clergy. Subsequently, with the help of democrats of all sides within the Government who pulled off a coup, many soldiers including Agha Petros decided to participate in this coup as the military side, which subsequently was given all the power for a temporary period to purge all enemies of the fledging democracy. While some would suspect eternal martial law, Agha Petros promises that he will give in to all democratic forces in the country in due time."
asy.4.a:0 "And so, the Middle East gains a democracy."
asy.5.title:0 "Holy Russia Returns"
asy.5.desc:0 "And so, with all these populist forces around the country formerly known as Assyria causing chaos and resulting in tyranny from the majority, it is clear that only through the guidance of Holy Russia and her great Petrogadschina we can save the Caucasus as a whole from ruin and division. We must think in ways greater than ourselves - in ways of union, in ways of progress and yet of tradition. Thusly, the Caucasus Brigade, pledging allegiance to the Russian Empire, has seized Hakkari and shall begin efforts to re-create the Caucasian General Governorate which was dissolved after the various declarations of independence that occured during the 1920s and 1910s. No longer - we shall go on in our crusade to re-establish our great Governorate in total subservience to the Russian Empire, and to Kolchak. Kolchak will bring us to the future, and we will help Holy Russia with oil and other resources!"
asy.5.a:0 "For our Holy Empire!"
asy.6.title:0 "Give Kurds the vote?"
asy.6.desc:0 "Kurds are a very large number of our population, although not the majority fortunately. Many liberals and social democrats especially in our country have said that it is an insult to our birthing democracy that we won't give them the vote, but many conservatives say that giving non-Assyrians the vote would be expanding too much what it means to be Assyrian, and subsequently resulting in actual Assyrian voices being muddled by Kurdish people. What shall be done by our military government?"
asy.6.a:0 "What works, works. Don't give them the vote."
asy.6.b:0 "Kurds are our nationals, they deserve it."
asy.7.title:0 "First Assyrian Elections"
asy.7.desc:0 "As we go forward transitioning away from military regime to proper civilian Government, we have reached the first time many Assyrians have heard of the idea of voting, and so it has become quite the challenge to ensure that everyone in the country votes properly. Regardless, it has gone relatively well, with a 65 percent turnout across the country. Regardless, only one can come out on top, and so, the votes have been counted - and the party that has won is..."
asy.7.a:0 "The Conservative GAD!"
asy.7.b:0 "The Social Democratic GSA!"
