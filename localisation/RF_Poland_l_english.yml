#LEADER DESCRIPTIONS#
POL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Following the collapse of Germany and Russia following the great war, Poland would be reborn out of the ashes from centuries of foreign domination. Led by General Piłsudski Poland was able to overcome and defeat the threats surrounding them, from Germany, Russia and Czechoslovakia, through the formation of a eastern Europe defensive pact called "The Intermarium". It has been over 15 years since this however and Piłsudski has gotten old. Bed ridden from cancer few know how long he will live, but it is only a matter of time till the Great Marshal loses his final battle."

#DECISIONS (1.5 Update)#
#EVENTS#
poland.1.t:0 "Piłsudski's absence"
poland.1.desc:0 "The public worries as our great marshal and head of the state Józef Piłsudski hasn't left his home for two weeks. His poor health has been on decline for few years now but it has never left him strapped down to bed before. Many claim that we have to prepare for the worst."
poland.1.a:0 "The nation prays for him"
poland.2.t:0 "The Death of the Marshal"
poland.2.desc:0 "What everyone feared the most has finally happened. At an age of 69, Józef Piłsudski, our dear Marshal of Poland has died after a long battle with liver cancer. He left behind grieving family and a nation on a crossroads. While nominally democratic, Poland was practically ruled by him with his influence being an open secret. Now that he is gone, no one is truly sure what can happen."
poland.2.a:0 "Let us remember his successes and mourn his passing."
poland.4.t:0 "The Gathering of Emergency Government"
poland.4.desc:0 "The entire sanation bloc is troubled by questions, \"What to do now? Who should take the reign?\" Should it be the current government?, now freed from dictatorial power? Will it be able to democratize the nation and bring its citizens freedom and prosperity? Will it be the army? A Military takeover might be necessery to prevent chaos from shaking both Poland and the entire Intermarium. Or may there be... a third option? A Fresh and dynamic movement, developed over the years in the fringes of Piłsudski's camps. While seen as crackpots by their opponents, the organisation seemed to be fiercely loyal to marshal and thus deemed harmless and not worthy of persectution. It meanwhile grew using ideas of socialism, nationalism and anti-imperialism to gain supporters from seemingly opposing camps. Lead by controversial artist Stanisław Szukalski and an even more controversial philosopher, Jan Stachniuk. Both promising to bring Poland to greatness never seen before in its entire history..."
poland.4.a:0 "It is clear that the Marshal's work is done, we will be a democracy."
poland.4.b:0 "The Marshal's death must be harnessed and Poland propelled to greatness!"
poland.4.c:0 "Our enemies will take advantage of our mourning, bring forth the military government!"
poland.3.t:0 "Marshal laid to rest"
poland.3.desc:0 "Crowds of size not remembered in ages gathered in city of Krakow to pay their last respects to the Marshal of Poland; her leader Józef Piłsudski. Despite some resistance from members of the catholic clergy that holds the historic building in custody he was burried in vault under Wawel Cathedral, the traditional place of rest of Polish kings and national heroes. Flocks of grieving Poles were accompanied by numerous foreign guests including official envoys from member-states of the Intermarium alliance as well Prussia and the U.K. More insightful eyes could also spot controversial Russian politician Alexander Kazembek amongst the guests."
poland.3.a:0 "May he rest in peace."
poland.5.t:0 "A Controversial grave"
poland.5.desc:0 "Death of Marshal Piłsudski emboldened his political opponents. Group of protesters gathered today before parliament building in Warsaw demanding removal of Piłsudski's body from Wawel vault claiming that the funeral was done against wishes of both the Catholic Church and the Polish nation. The illegal demonstrations were ended by police and some of the activists were arrested. There has been no official response from the Polish Episcopacy."
poland.5.a:0 "This doesn't bode well."
poland.6.t:0 "Artist riot"
poland.6.desc:0 "Unexpected unrest started in Krakow's Academy of Fine Arts where argument between groups of students over philosophical matters turned into open clashes. Supporters of classical academia and critique engaged in violent fights with acolites of Szukalski and his more free-spirited and less academic aproach to art. Debate was espacially heated becouse of political implications of the given arguments. Luckilly police was easilly subdue unruly student and everything ended without serious bodily harm to either side."
poland.6.a:0 "Last thing we need is to end up like France."
poland.7.t:0 "Artist riot"
poland.7.desc:0 "Unexpected unrest started in Krakow's Academy of Fine Arts where argument between groups of students over philosophical matters turned into open clashes. Supporters of classical academia and critique engaged in violent fights with acolites of Szukalski and his more free-spirited and less academic aproach to art. Debate was espacially heated becouse of political implications of the given arguments as well as Szukalski's position within goverment. Luckilly police was easilly subdue unruly student and everything ended without serious bodily harm to either side. Pro-academia students as well as some teachers expressed concern over police treating Szukalski's supporters way more leniently."
poland.7.a:0 "Art is born in pain."
poland.8.t:0 "National Pantheon"
poland.8.desc:0 "After many debates and revisions finally began first works on the \"Duchtynia\", a national monumental building which is to serve as crypt of proudest sons and daughters of the Polish nation as well as her spiritual center. Grand concrete structure designed by Leader himself is to be a seamless hybrid of ancient slavic burials and cutting edge architecture and technology. Despite work being more than likely many years from being finished, construction is already attracting criticism as a \"pagan temple in a heart of catholic nation\" as described in an official letter from Archbishops."
poland.8.a:0 "Wonderful way to honour our identity and our heroes."
poland.9.t:0 "Dawn of a democratic coalition"
poland.9.desc:0 "The election carried out by temporary government resulted in Ignacy Daszyński, leader of Polish Socialist Party, claiming the title of the president, as well as many members of both wings of the Polish Popular Party getting seats in the reintroduced parliament. Despite that, Poland still needed major changes before she could be called a free democratic country. So in order to ensure that reforms will be passed with little to no resistance from right-wing extremists and national collectivists, PPS, PSL-\"Piast\"" and PSL-\"Liberation\" formed the Democratic Popular Front and as a result have taken majority of both the senate and sejm."
poland.9.a:0 "Could this be the beggining of our freedom?"
poland.10.t:0 "Augustus the Strong"
poland.10.desc:0 "Cinemas across Prussia and Poland hits \"Augustus the Strong\" (German title: August der Starke, Polish title: August Mocny), a polish-prussian cooproduction. The epic is praised by critics for historical accuracy and attention to details in life of the german king of Poland. It is also seen by both sides as an attempt at warming relations between two nations. \nSadly premiere didn't went completly without incidents as acts of vandalism to the poster displays in some cinemas were reported. Clear link with communist activity isn't yet established but highly suspected."
poland.10.a:0 "May this be a symbol of a growing friendship."
poland.11.t:0 "Island of Sages"
poland.11.desc:0 "Premiere of the last episode of the awaited \"Island of Sages\" (Wyspa Mędrców) movie serial didn't went without controversy. While adaptation of the first book in the series under the same title was praised for high production values and acting chops of Witold Roland as main antagonist, some criticised it as \"blantant propaganda\". Director, Leonard Buczkowski demented the accusations stating to be merely faithfully adapting source material which is already few years old. \"Was Maria Buyno-Arctowa trying to flatter current goverment writing her book eight years ago? If yes, powers of her mind are more superhuman than those possesed by her characters.\" Buczkowski answered in a press interview."
poland.11.a:0 "Wonderful series, as always."
poland.12.t:0 "Great findings in Biała!"
poland.12.desc:0 "In village of Biała nearby Lódź archeologists discovered an ancient relic: urn used by ancient slavs to burry ash of their dead. Well preserved artifact is covered in enigmatic symbols that will surely give our historians something to argue about and artists to spin into rushes of creatvity."
poland.12.a:0 "This will help us learn about our past."
poland.12.b:0 "Another pagan junk to the collection."
poland.13.t:0 "Writing Reform"
poland.13.desc:0 "Today marks the date when official Commission on National Font begins its works. While government is working tirelessly in its efforts to industrialise the nation and colectivise the farming, cultural aspect of transformations cannot be underestimated by no means. Alongside reform of education making it more suited for future poles well aware of their cultural and ethnic heritage, proposed was also smaller but quite interesting development. \n Unlike nations like Germany with fraktur or Britain with Gaelic script, Poland never managed to show its uniqueness by establishing suited for its language typeface. And how with merely using western tools can we create not just literature made in Poland but true Polish Literature?\nCommission emploing finest artists and grapical designer alongside scholars of polish language will try to create elegant typeface to use both in pring and handwriting. One at once simple, elegant and uniquely suited for specifics of our language."

poland.50.t:0 "The Premiere of \"Revolt\""
poland.50.desc:0 "Today took place the premiere of newest achievement of polish cinema: \"Revolt\" (original title \"Bunt\") based on a book under the same title by nobel prize winner Władysław Reymont. Directed by pioneer of animation Władysław Starewicz feature is crowning achivement of his so far. Masterly crafted, lifelike dolls of animals walk, fight and play in the most lifelike manner adding to the grim atmosfere of the tale of a tragic in consequences uprising of farm animals against their masters. Obvious parallels between Raymont's story and failed Russian Revolution are kept within the movie with ending hinting at revolution at other homestead (Germany) perpetuating the cycle."
poland.50.a:0 "Ok"

poland.51.t:0 "Endless Sky"
poland.51.desc:0 "Surprisingly successful is a recently published book by historian Wacław Anczyc under the title \"Endless Sky\". A significant departure from the academic works Anczyc has produced throughout his career, Endless Sky is a collection of allohistorical short stories set in an Europe completely rearranged by an even more successful Genghis Khan. The Great Khan who in Endless Sky is declared the prophet of Tengri not only reaches France with his conquests, but also codifies the Tengriist faith leading to its proselytization in the Mongol Empire. The massive upheaval caused results in a second migration period leading to poles (under the banner of the Semi-Mongolised 'Lechite Horde') settling in eastern Germany and Slavs reaching as far as the region we know as Denmark. The stories aren't directly linked with each other by any recurring characters and take place in vastly different countries in the 15th century such as: a syncretic Tengri-Pagan Lithuania; Rani, the Slavic settlement in Denmark; The Holy Roman Empire, relegated to Germany's Rhineland; A united Iberia, where the Mohammedan and Christian unite against their common Heathen enemy; and the marginalised Papal State suffering greatly from loss of legitimacy rivalled by dozens of Anti-Papacies set by the remaining Christian states and some even by Mohammedan countries. \nStylistically the work is surprising for an author with an academic background; quite light, accessible, and depicts an implausible reality masterfully detailed by the author."
poland.51.a:0 "Such a compelling story."

poland.16.t:0 "Dictionary Reform"
poland.16.desc:0 "Our goals are stretching way beyond mere technological or economical betterment of our nation. If we only focused on production of goods, cannons or planes we would be no better than communists in Germany who do the same. No, our most sacred, most divine goal is to rekindle the living flame of the spirit of Poland and whole of Slavdom that for centuries smoldered giving out barely any light. This flame needs to burn bright, scorch rotten leaves of the centuries past that our men and women drown in. But how we can even attempt to start such revolution when the very words we use are not of us but about us? How a Slav is to revolutionise something when he doesn't even have native word for such revolution? Our vocabularies are filled to the brim with useless trinkets we collected out of dumpsters of other nations. Mere garbage others throw away we treat like relics of higher cultures. A potato, a cucumber or a palace suddenly becomes more noble, more thoughtful when we name in a way others do. Latin, french, german, english and even jidish are for poles True Languages that our crooked speech of quaint hicks can only borrow from. \n\nNO MORE!\n\nWe shall purify our language and through this pure language we will finally be able to communicate Slavic thoughts in Slavic way. A special commission will be established sniffing for unwanted aliens in our language and replacing them with native words. All government approved publications, broadcasts and movies will be obliged to comply with the reform ensuring faster spread of the corrected language.\nOf course a heated debate rages on within the movement on how far the reform should go. Should we bring the heat of the purifying flame to the older works or words of the dead bards are sanctified by their notability alone? How far should we go with the reform? What languages are close enough to our own to make borrowing a mere sharing of common Slavic speech among brotherly nations? Those debates while sometimes heated shall pass in time bringing us to a consensus and more so to our goal."
poland.16.a:0 "This is OUR language! Not german, not english!"

poland.17.t:0 "Dożynki"
poland.17.desc:0 "The traditional celebration of successful harvest has its roots in ancient Slavic rites performed to the gods of nature. Long before the dragon of the “Western civilization” started to sap on life force of our race, our ancestors exercised their collective spirit in a healthy way suited for our culture and ethnicity. The occupying forces couldn’t simply destroy our spirit for the soul of a Slav is a tree which roots dig deep into the soil of the Earth. Instead they used subversion to harness those rituals to their own means. But luckily the ritual and the love of the common man is still strong within our nation.\nTo the surprised relief of some of the farmers and silent horror of some clergy we not only didn’t try to prevent the celebrations, we made sure that this year ones will in whole country be remembered as the most exquisite, most elaborate and life-affirming anyone ever remembered. Not for nothing we are a movement of planners and artists: not boring speeches and dry sermons but vitalistic theater, awe inspiring songs and performances, elaborate costumes and decorations brought into the fields of our villages rekindled pride of the common man. Pride in his nation, his race, his ancestors and his accomplishments. We didn’t prevent the clergy from bringing in their shallow and boring babble into the celebrations for not only it would give them so desired sense of victim-hood that the “Black Internationale” of the cosmopolitan church of Rome feeds off but also would not allow people to see how dwarfish, malformed and senile their efforts truly are."
poland.17.a:0 "Wesołych świąt!"

poland.18.t:0 "The Misstress of Air"
poland.18.desc:0 "Female pilots are nothing new in Poland, even rather talented ones as our nation never subscribed to small minded ideas plaguing many places in the world that forbid skilled pilots from taking wings just because of their womanhood. None the less rise of a true talent and an ace-in-the-making is always a cause for celebration, made so much rarer of that the incoming star of our air force is indeed a woman. On the ground, a mild mannered and timid girl from Greater Poland in the skies had shown unusual bravery and skill letting her finish her training with highest honors. She is ready to take her place in a fighter wing at any moment."
