POLITICS_Cheng_Qian_DESC:0 "“Cheng Qian has ambition, aware of the overall situation, conscientiously practice the legacy of Mr. Song Jiaoren. He himself did not understand the MinSeng doctrine , but still allowed us to carry out land reform and social reform.”——Liao Zhongkai\n\nCheng qian was born in liling , Hunan province in 1877. In 1900, he was admitted to Yuelu academy in Changsha, where he learned about the current situation and decided to give up his literature and practice martial arts. After meeting Sun Yat-sen in Japan, he joined the TMH and became a loyal follower of Sun. After the death of Sun Yat-sen, Cheng Qian, like most officers, remained loyal to Song jiaoren.\n\nThe subsequent northern expedition completely changed his fate. Cheng Qian, the leader of the sixth corps of NRA, led his soldiers into Wuhan and defeated the warlords in the following battle of the Central Plains War. Even the well-known Wu Peifu was killed by Cheng's subordinates. After the penetration of International Intervention Forces, Cheng Qian assessed the situation, reorganized the sixth corps and other forces of the pro-left NRA, and led them back to Hunan. At the later Nanjing Conference, Cheng used his deliberately retained military power and paid nominal obedience to the Nanjing government in exchange for the position of governor of Hunan province.\n\nIn 1936, Cheng Qian carefully maintained a fragile balance between the Zhang and Xu. He allowed his MinSheng Clique and Workers' Party to carry out experimental land reform and social reform, and hired German industrial consultants to help Hunan achieve basic industrialization. Almost everyone thinks Hunan's future is bright, unless something unexpected happens..."
