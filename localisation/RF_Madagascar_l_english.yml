POLITICS_RANAVALONA_III_DESC:0 "Born July 30 1861, the reign of Queen Ranavalona III is perhaps one of the most unusual in recorded history, for which sovereign could claim to fight valiantly against encroaching foreign influence, be gracious upon losing the divine mandate, then returning triumphantly to reinstate it and free her people from foreign chains? \n Yet things are unfortunately never so simple, born into a time where the sovereign of the Kingdom of Madagascar had become largely a ceremonial figure. Ironically this happened, unlike in western countries, not because of the machinations of liberals or peasants but a coup by Prime Minister Rainivoninahitriniony with support of the army and nobles in 1863. Killing the incumbent Radama II (rumors of the King’s survival in obscurity remain to this day however) and replacing the absolute authority of the sovereign with power being 'shared' with the Prime Minister, recruited from the nobility. Of course the subsequent monarchs largely then fell under the thumb of the Prime Minister. This was the lot of Ranavalona III too, with the bulk of her duties being to deliver pre written speeches, attending ceremonies and overseeing meetings. This ended abruptly in 1897 with the french who had been bickering with british for long whose domain the island should be, annexing the island proper, ending the monarchy and forcing her into exile in Algiers and under the watchful eyes of the French. Here she would have lived out the rest of the days as a high society socialite and occasional tourist to France, if fate didn't have the devastation of the Great War in store. Suddenly the great colonial empire of the french was thrown into turmoil, their grasp slipping as internal and economic instability took them. And it was in this turmoil that to Ranavalona’s villa in the midst of the night a host of malagasy nobles came. Proclaiming their undying loyalty after overwhelming her french retainers, after over two decades she finally saw her beloved homeland again. With the French signing a treaty to concede most of the island except the port of Diego-Suarez, in a grand parade through the nation tens of thousands of her people welcomed their sovereign back, alas whilst the crown she now wears is a new one the system that contains her is not. With her being the same figurehead she was since her youth. Worse yet, Ranavalona is now an old woman long battling with an embolism that slowly but surely des, with no heir apparent as the only one sporting a rightful claim, Marie-Louise, choosing to forego her divine right in favor of the palors and madness of the reborn French State. With the aristocracy long plotting to take even what little power she still has left may see this as the perfect time to strike. In the end Ranavalona could only realize that the gracious given to her by fate was in the end only borrowed time and despite her best efforts she may truly be the last of the Malagasy monarchs..."
POLITICS_DIDELOT_DESC:0 "Born December 21 1902, Francis Didelot was always a man of two worlds. Born on malagasy soil a descendant to the great Edgar Allen Poe into the islands sizeable french enclave, Didelot spend much of his youth travelling across the world due to his father's position as a colonial governor. Yet despite his distant travels, he always felt a special connection to both the land where he was born and the land of his parents. Following his great ancestors footsteps, he cast away his first existence as a lawyer to pursue a career in writing. Covering a wide range of subjects from historical papers about the theater to writing play for it himself, to writing texts for radio and the burgeoning media of TV. However in 1931 he was uprooted, Artaud’s revolution forever tainting the memory and beauty of his beloved second homeland. Cast adrift he returned to his first homeland a broken man. Yet the mistress of fate is truly capricious, and he soon found himself surrounded by hundreds of his countrymen who had befallen the same fate. Vowing to at least preserve some of France’s greatness, they worked and lobbied unendingly for Madagascar to finally the shackles of monarchism and become a Republic, and fate would award him once again: the death of queen Ranavalona III granted him the perfect opening to strike. Now Didelot is the President of one of the few african countries sporting a truly functioning democracy, alas even if France’s soul may be forever charred by Artaud’s madness perhaps he can preserve some of its soul on this distant island..."
POLITICS_REGENCY_COUNCIL_MADAGASCAR_DESC:0 "Thanks to the chaos and unrest that followed the gridlock of the Great War and the subsequent fires of revolution, monarchies have become quite the rare sight on the world stage, with absolute ones more so the pariah. The Kingdom of Madagascar has before they came under foreign boot and after they threw it off again been one of those now lone pariahs. Only this it is only on the surface, for since 'Aristocratic Revolution' of 1863, the regicide of King Radama II by the Prime Minister, sparked by the King’s choice to legalize the practice of dueling, power has mainly rested with the latter as well of course with the caste of aristocrats from whom the Prime Minister was recruited. In a cruel twist of fate this order was yet destroyed by the very men the aristocracy had invited so openly into their lands: the french, annexing the kingdom proper left the aristocrats merely as affluent landlords without much political say. With the fires of the Great War their time to strike came less than two decades later: with the french abandoning most of the islands, the aristocrats swiftly reinstated the system they had dominated. Alas even with queen Ranavalona III fully cooperating, many of the nobility saw the monarchy itself as a distant relic that only held the country back. With the queen leaving no heir apparent the perfect time to strike came: besting all other pretenders to control over the country and declaring an eternal regency, quietly and solemnly the Malagasy Monarchy has died..."
POLITICS_RALAIMONGO_DESC:0 "Born October 4 1884 in the region of Antoebe, born to a pastor in one of the many missions of Madagascar, Ralaimongo’s relationship with his country was of all those that reached for lordship over it during the chaos following queen Ranavalona III’s death the most difficult.For despite being born to a free man, the majority of his childhood he spent as a slave. Kidnapped at age seven along with most of his family, he was sold alone to a man from the region of Bara. Spending seven years as property, his salvation came from a most unexpected benefactor: the french.Whilst they cast his country 1897 in shackles, for Ralaimongo and tens of thousands this meant freedom as they brought with them the end of slavery.Returning to his family in 1898, retaining a deep seated gratitude to the french and an equally deep seated disgust for the old regime.Going on to become a teacher, he went on to repay some of the debt he felt he owned to France by manning the trenches for them during the Great War.Staying in Paris for some years after he immersed himself in intellectual circles, and even meeting the man that would one day take on the name of Ho Chi Minh.Organizing and agitating for a freer and more equal Madagascar since his return in 1924, Ralaimongo became a persistent thorn in the colonial administration and later the newly reborn kingdom’s sides.Now Ralaimongo stands at the helm of the first african country to embrace socialism: promising a truly free and democratic society for all those born behind and destroying the elites that shipped him and tens of thousand others as cattle, a new red dawn rises..."
POLITICS_RABEARIVELO_DESC:0 "Born March 4 1901, the name of Jean-Joseph Rabearivelo is in the minds of many, especially the francophone world often the first name that comes to mind upon hearing the word 'Madagascar'. Yet despite receiving the gift of immortality at such a young age and having admirers and believers all across the globe, the man still lives in much the same poverty he has lived in since the french seized his family’s wealth upon annexing the island.For underneath the image of a literary genius lies a deeply troubled man, for that which made him great is also his curse. His mind sparking interest in not only french literature but french and malagasy poetry caused him to immerse himself in that world from an early age, publishing his first poem at age fourteen.Alas this love also became a burden, for his love did not just extend to the literary realm alone but the movements of culture and politics, particularly surrealism and futurism. The latter he became perhaps inadvertently movements head of on his island as many young intellectuals flocked to him upon him expressing sympathy for the movement. Causing him to be ostracized by much of the countries establishment despite his international fame, becoming the target of frequent harassment and contempt after Ranavalona III’s restoration.Worse yet, in 1933 his only three year old daughter died due to illness. This caused him to dip even deeper into the vices he had already abused before: philandering, womanizing and his ever growing opium addiction.Multiple times he contemplated suicide over the years, till under the midday sun as he was already balancing a capsule filled with cyanide between his fingertips, suddenly a host of his followers came to his house. Frantically bringing him the news that Queen Ranavalona had died and the streets were already filled with blood, in a haze he followed his followers onto the streets, onwards onto the capital, still contemplating what to do he was suddenly hit with a jolt of clarity: he had not received sacred visions like Artaud did but perhaps because of his flaws he was destined to save his land and people.Taking the lead of the mass of his fellow futurists he led a valiant charge against the capital, vanquishing all that would dare stand in their way and proclaiming a new order, one of most delicate beauty and national rebirth.And while shunned by the mortal realm, as he and his followers unravel the border behind reality and that beyond, it is perhaps on the mystic shores of Lemuria that he will finally find peace..."

mag.7.desc:0 "Hamada had been a simple farmer a few years ago, growing corn and raising chicken with his brothers while their wives and his raised their children in the 4 hut complex that was reserved, in a sort of a sense, for their clan. Life had been, if not exciting, good and steady. He had worshipped the deities his father and his father’s fathers had paid tribute to. He awoke and went to sleep with the loud clucking of the chickens and the bickering of the extended household. The government rarely came knocking, and when it did, he could deal with them easily and comfortably, as if he was talking with an old friend that he met with once in a while for a reminscince of old times. He went down to the village every few days to sell the chicken to willing buyers and sometimes to get his corn to be sent off to the capital; both of these actions earned him a good hefty amount of currencies which would enable him to manage the clan’s estate and ensure tutoring for his older brother’s son Rinjala, who while speaking rarely and had some issues with social interaction, was turning out to be a genius who’s intellect was neutered by British tutors. \n That had seemed so long ago, that idyllic village life, being the head of his family…\n It had been an ordinary day; Hamada and two of his children were spending some valuable time together gawking at the goods of the village market. They were fussing with the owner of the fish stall over the price of some smoked rainbowfish when there was the distant growl of the engine. This had heralded the arrival of the Miaramilan'ny, a rowdy bunch of artists and other elements who came proclaiming the beginning of a new order in Madagascar. This village, in particular, were to be handed over to a French corporation who was interested in developing it as a resort of types for creatives who would be inspired by the calm environment of the Malagasy countryside. When the village council of elders rejected this proposal politely, the leader of the Miaramilan'ny squad laughed and pointed at the barrel of his gun. With that Hamada was forced to begin a new life in the city, the capital of Antananarivo. Urban life, with the surrealist regime in charge, was a flurry of industry, of change, of the casual smashing of traditions that had been upheld in Madagascar for hundreds of years. Within a week, his 2nd youngest brother’s third oldest daughter was making money as a paint dancer in the clubs, his oldest brother had dumped aside his particular devotion for the old gods for a curious new belief from the British Raj called Thelema, and his children were now speaking a form of bastardized French they had picked up from the school, where allegedly nothing was taught but art and astrology. \n Hamada’s life hadn’t been destroyed exactly yet, but it had certainly experienced a total turn due to the rise of the Malagasy State…."

mag.8.desc:0 "Emile had always been in a world between reality and something else. When she was six, a little girl living in the shantytowns of Madagascar’s capital with her prostitute mother and her smoking brother who was always on the reach of a job but apparently always had it snatched it away ‘by those damn Indians’, she had her first... episode. She had been playing with a stray cat on the streets, near the walls of a large sugar warehouse, when two large goldfish streamed out of the open doors of the back of the warehouse. They were to be her first real friends; all the other little kids in the shantytown made fun of her for her French name, and her mother’s work, and how her right thumb was missing. Emile remembered them, floating about and inviting them to play with her. She would soon give them names: Georges and Ameline. The next four years with them were the best of her life. She explored the hidden sides of the shantytown with them, created artwork as they served as her muse, and explained her views on life and proto-philosophy to them. But all things had to end and one day, her mother gave her a strange yellow-as-a-banana-skin liquid and her adventures with the two giant goldfish came to an end. She filled up her time with more artwork (and all the tools were provided by a generous elderly woman who spoke with a faint French accent at the west end of the shantyville) since they were too poor to go to school; she amusingly remembers how her brother paid her 1,001 Ariary to do 10 detailed sketches of a singular cigarette, multiple cigarettes together, and a cigarette box.\n\nIt was her 11th birthday when she was noticed by some men in good hats as she sketched on a table. They introduced themselves as staff from the Antananarivo School of Creativity and expressed admiration for her skills along with an invitation to go to come to their school. She left a note on her mother’s table and never looked back. She moved in with one of the school’s administrators, a man claiming to be her uncle, and began her study of art. Five years later she graduated, and went forth boldly into the adult world. Alas, the Malagsy people had other things to worry about then their development of culture. A revolution had broken out: the Malagasy people were ousting the French oppressors. Emile had hid under a large mahogany colored hat in a corner of a street for four days, but the beggar occupying the abandoned furniture store next to her argued she was just sitting there in her dress.\n\nTwo years passed by like a boat passing down a stream; Emile found work here and there, painting for small businessmen and wealthy foreigners. This period passed without much event.\n Now, another revolution had came fourth. One that appreciated her talents and legacy, actually. The futurists, led by the venerable and great poet Jean-Joseph Rabearivelo, overthrew the stale monarchy and had unleashed a regime of dreams.\nNow, she has become an accomplished writer and painter, a poet and has become one of Rabearivelo's "Rejuvenativist Group" artists, which are considered the most accomplished artists of Madagascar. Her life has changed."

And finally, the gorgeous and unchartered, mystical and esoteric south, which is drier and for only the most dedicated explorers. However, a government is not only made of natural beauty, but also of their people, and we have are a very diverse, yet homogenous country with many sub-ethnic groups within the Malagasy race such as the Betsileo, Betsimisaraka and Merina, all of them very united but through traditional forms of Unity - leftover from the Merina Kingdom and the French occupation. To overcome this archaic union, we must unite ourselves under something stronger, something more powerful, a National Myth, as idealized by Georges Sorel, a wonderful French thinker, which believed a nation needed something beyond the truth to become something greater and not fall into decay and misery, riding towards the Future. Subsequently, we have looked into the ideas of esoteric writers and artists across the country and of foreign explorers who believe this land to be Lemuria - and this feels... right. It feels right to us - it feels right to our people, right to our Government, right to our State. It feels right for our Nation!

However, one unforeseen consequence of this is its effect on traditional gender roles and beliefs on sexuality. Previous, the Malagasy people were firm protestants, and believed that homosexuality was amoral and that anyone who dared suggest that they were any gender besides the one they were assigned at birth are simply mentally ill. But that was the past, and now ours is a society of social progress. As homosexual and transgender comrades make themselves comfortable in our new society, the government should express official support for these communities."
