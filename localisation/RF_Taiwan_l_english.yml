#DECISIONS (1.5 Update)#

#EVENTS#

tai.1.t:0 "Breaking Free"
tai.1.d:0 "The Provisional Independence Council was set up to safeguard Taiwan against any immediate attempts to subjugate it upon declaring independence. However it was unstable from the start, made up of liberal moderates such as the influential Thomas Liao, Nationalist icon Chiang Wei-shui and Communist leaders. The group can scarecly agree on whether they will keep the name Taiwan or be recognised as Formosa, never mind matters of economy or defence. The council is rapidly disintegrating and the island faces a potent choice in the near future, the exact players involved and their policies remain to seen however..."
tai.1.a:0 "At least we have self-determination now."
tai.1.b:0 "Despots never have these problems."

tai.1001.t:0 "The Aboriginal Rebellion"
tai.1001.d:0 "The Aboriginal tribes in the highlands have been making trouble for the various leaders of Taiwan for decades, now with the absence of the Japanese colonists, Mona Rudao the notorious leader of the Atayal Seediq tribes has launched ferocious attacks on Han settlers in the Northern Highlands, much worse than the Wushe incidents of 1930. Among his insurgents the orphans of the first Wushe incident, boys whose fathers, brothers, uncles and cousins were beheaded at the hands of Japanese collaborating natives. Now eager to return the favour, these savage warriors are threatening not only the their local clan rivals and the Japanese settlers, but the Chinese as well. Mona's men are a formidable guerrilla force, able to strike at any time and disappear into the brush at will. They are united by a desire for autonomy and the retreat of Chinese settlers from their traditional lands. The decision of how to handle Mona has become a serious issue for the unstable provisional government, some suggest the natives should be Sinicised and their cultures eliminated along similar lines the Japanese had planned. Others suggest they be allowed their autonomy and further that they be protected by law, their unique identity is becoming a new focal point for Taiwanese national sentiment, separate from the Min-Hokkien and Hakka-Chinese identities that dominate the West of island."
tai.1001.a:0 "Taiwan is Chinese. Find Mona and kill him."
tai.1001.b:0 "The Natives Deserve Recognition. Accept his demands."

tai.2.t:0 "Free Elections Organised"
tai.2.d:0 "Out of the turmoil of the Provisional Independence Council a plebicite has been organised at last. The moderates look set to win, but the chances of one-party rule are slim, Liao may not command enough votes to win out-right and the left vote is split between the TCP and TPP. If a power sharing deal can be worked out between Chiang and Liao then there is the possibility of a compromise there. On the other hand significant radical elements may push to disrupt the elections altogether..."
tai.2.a:0 "Democracy offers stability in these trying times."
tai.2.b:0 "Democracy may solve nothing in the end."

tai.3.t:0 "The Chaos Descends"
tai.3.d:0 "The Provisional Independence Council has failed and the Government is dissolved, with no leadership and shortages beginning, chaos has gripped the streets in Taipei. In the countryside Aboriginal elements raid the lands of Chinese farmers and in urban areas students are up in arms. The crisis deepens by the day as parties begin to organise 'People's Militias' to defend their properties and beat up political opponents. Some say the TCP is organising a coup, others whisper about the mysterious PPP fliers covering entire buildings and street signs, they appear to pop up in the thousands overnight."
tai.3.a:0 "Will someone please DO something?!"
tai.3.b:0 "This whole independence thing seems to have been a mistake."

tai.4.t:0 "Leftists Attack the Government"
tai.4.d:0 "At last men of action have taken matters into their own hands. At dawn the People's Militias of the TCP and TPP joined forces in a rare show of soldiarity, they assembled near the University grounds and were soon joined by disgruntled students. The band marched through Taipei into the morning, attracting a police presence, some officers simply joined the march while others looked on. By the time the march reached the Government district they had swelled into a mob, they were now joined by factory workers and civilians waiving flags and shouting slogans. When the march approached the National Assembly they found it guarded by soldiers and police, for an hour a stand-off ensued, then the first rock was thrown. Then the first fires were lit. Finally the first shot was fired. From then it was a battle, soldiers and police engaged in shoot-outs while the mob rushed into the building. When the dust had settled the people had won, those among them shot dead were now martyrs of the Revolution, including some party leaders. More importantly Taiwan now has leadership."
tai.4.a:0 "At last!"
tai.4.b:0 "At what cost?"

tai.5.t:0 "TCP Takes Power"
tai.5.d:0 "In the aftermath of the Revolution it didn't take long for the TCP to take charge of the situation, their supporters were more numerous, several TPP leaders were dead, and it only took one good lie to convince the crowds the TPP had killed fellow revolutionaries in the crossfire. After that it was trivial to arrest any who didn't swear feilty to the new Government."
tai.5.a:0 "The traitors get what they deserve."
tai.5.b:0 "So much for Solidarity."

tai.6.t:0 "TPP Takes Power"
tai.6.d:0 "In the aftermath of the Revolution the TPP came out on top. TCP leaders had been killed in the crossfire and without their leadership the mob simply obeyed the loudest voice in the room, in this case - Chiang. Some TCP members refused to lay down their arms, prompting their arrest and 'trial' by the remaining Police. Chiang quickly set about smoothing over some soured relations and even invited leaders of the other parties to help form the Government."
tai.6.a:0 "The icon prevails!"
tai.6.b:0 "Moderates will betray the Revolution."

tai.7.t:0 "Radicals in the Streets"
tai.7.d:0 "With the PIC all but dissolved and the other political powers beating eachother up, a new force has come to play a role, the Pen and Pencils Party. Despite the name this group of radicals has its own organised street gang, visible by their flamboyant yellow uniforms and blue arm-bands. They have quickly set about plastering the streets of all major urban areas with fliers. The posters are adorned with pastel colours and speak of the cultural soul of Taiwan being in a state of decay, only the PPP can save it. Attached is a treatise, a brief manifesto from the painter Tan Ting-pho. The Pen and Pencil Treatise has spread throughout the island and taken the interest of many, plans to make Taiwan truly it's own, not a slave to Japan or China nor even to Asia. The Treatise claims Taiwan is and can make itself the centre of the world, through cultural revival and social cooperation the island can become great as never before! All it will take is the will and vision to do so. The party has been denounced as French boot-lickers and sell-outs to western imperialists by their opponents, but there is no denying their growing popularity."
tai.7.a:0 "The Treatise will guide the nation."
tai.7.b:0 "Let's hope these radicals know what they're doing."

tai.8.t:0 "Liao's Liberals Win Election"
tai.8.d:0 "Against all odds Liao's Liberal party has won the election, when interviewed Liao thanked his supporters and pledged to unite the fledgling nation, to keep out foreign powers and make Taiwan a strong and prosperous land."
tai.8.a:0 "Cooler heads have prevailed it seems."
tai.8.b:0 "At least we can move on now."

tai.9.t:0 "Lin's Grand Coalition Forms"
tai.9.d:0 "It has become apparent the election has returned no decisive winner. So Liberal leader Liao has reached out to elements from the now defunt PIC as well as more conservative members of the TPP who opposed cooperation with the communists. The end result is a power sharing deal between the Liberals and other political groups into a grand coalition led by Taiwan's wealthiest man - Lin Hsiung-Cheng."
tai.9.a:0 "Moderate cooperation? Here, now? What is the world coming to?"
tai.9.b:0 "Thank goodness for that!"

tai.10.t:0 "Tan Ting-pho Emerges as Leader"
tai.10.d:0 "PPP leader Tan Ting-pho has gone public at last, his latest address was in public and in person, despite the risk of assassination. He declared his true intentions for Taiwan, even as he spoke the Yellow-Jackets stormed the Government buildings. They were armed with painted rifles and pistols with intricate carvings, they quickly swept away any resistance at gun-point and promptly tore down the symbols of old colonial rule and burnt them. A large print of Tan Ting-pho's self portrait was hung in the main parliament chamber, government officials who refused to swear loyalty to the new leader in sight of the painting were shot. Tan pledged to use their ashes in his next work."
tai.10.a:0 "Now THIS is a leader I can get behind."
tai.10.b:0 "Who the hell paints with men's ashes?!"

tai.11.t:0 "Tan Ting-pho Speaks!"
tai.11.d:0 "PPP leader Tan Ting-pho announced the start of his party's rule today, the leading members of the Chi-Hsing Society took to the Taipei city square, they stood atop podiums and spoke to an entranced crowd of the great future that lies before their island nation. They lionised the bravery of native leader Mona Rudao, they called on their fellow citizens to begin a frenzy of popular expression. The Yellow-Jackets kept relative order as the crowds were whipped into a mob of discontent, then together the Club leaders and the people marched into Government unopposed. The Club announced that the Assembly Hall would become a new exhibition of the works of the people, most forms of expression were permitted to be displayed. Notable exceptions included traditional Chinese or Japanese works. Taiwanese Aboriginal works were subject to ideological scrutiny, those that did not please the Club's sensibilities were burnt. The seat of Government now resides at the Club's headquarters in Chiayi, its first act - replacing the Taiwanese Police with it's own Yellow-Jackets. A spate of brutal reprisals against Communist activists has resulted in the Police Stations being nick-named 'Hornets Nests' by some locals."
tai.11.a:0 "The Club seem very capable."
tai.11.b:0 "Do the ends justify the means?"

tai.12.t:0 "Taiwan Reaches Out to Tokyo"
tai.12.d:0 "In these desperate times true comrades ought to stick together. Since the revolution is isolated in Asia, the few who remain true to the proletariat must help one another in solidarity. To this end Taipei has taken the decision to reach out to Tokyo and offer what meagre support we can offer the Japanese. Perhaps in return they will assist us in the future."
tai.12.a:0 "Together Comrades, we will be unstoppable!"
tai.12.b:0 "As long as we aren't a colony again right?"

tai.13.t:0 "Liao Cracks Down on Corporate"
tai.13.d:0 "Just as outside businesses began to believe Liao's rule would bring the entirety of Taiwan under the Legation scheme, he announced sweeping regulations of the markets. Taiwanese businesses were given priority over outsiders and the status of the natives in the Highlands was elevated to bring an end to the rebellion and make amends for past friction."
tai.13.a:0 "We must keep the market free if we are to be free from the market."
tai.13.b:0 "Who will regulate the regulators?"

tai.14.t:0 "Lin Invites Businesses"
tai.14.d:0 "The economy is set to soar as the new stock exchange in Taipei opens today to raptious trading and number crunching from Taiwanese and foreign investors alike, the papers are sure to write of an economic miracle on Taiwan as the island emerges as one of the only stable economies in Asia. Under the surface however there are rumblings of land sales in the East of the island, some are concerned that the native insurgency could worsen if the island infringes upon their lands even more. The ever illusive Mona Rudao and his warriors could yet be the undoing of Lin's coalition..."
tai.14.a:0 "Business is Good!"
tai.14.b:0 "Should we warn them about Mona?"

tai.15.t:0 "Propose The South China Trade"
tai.15.d:0 "Since the British are struggling to keep their Empire together we should make them an offer they cannot refuse. We shall take stewardship over Weihaiwei and Pulo Condre on their behalf, in return the Brits get a lucrative export contract with Taiwan and increased diplomatic influence with the island nation. Though Taipei wishes not to join the Commonwealth, it may have its hand forced should it's territorial security be put at risk."
tai.15.a:0 "At Least We Aren't Asking For Honk Kong."
tai.15.b:0 "At Least We Aren't Asking For Malaya."

tai.151.t:0 "Taiwan Proposes South China Trade"
tai.151.d:0 "The Taiwanese, recently independent thanks to the Japanese collapse, have approached us with plans for a trade deal. Britain gets the economic benefits of Taiwanese exports, the Taiwanese in return have asked for control over Weihaiwei and Pulo Condre. They claim they will guarantee British interests in China and aleviate the burden on the Navy of patrolling and supplying these areas. The delegation in Hong Kong made a grand pitch of the potential for Anglo-Taiwanese co-operation in the future, some at home have expressed incredulity at the prospect of handing the territroies to this feldgling state that not a few months ago was a Japanese colony. Others have pointed out we are in desperate need of friends in these trying times and the Taiwanese offer of economic partnership is too tempting to refuse."
tai.151.a:0 "A fair trade."
tai.151.b:0 "A preposterous suggestion!"

tai.152.t:0 "Taiwan Strikes Deal with Britain"
tai.152.d:0 "The British, eager to retain power in Asia where they can get it, have accepted our offer. Taiwanese administrators have arrived in the British offices in Weihaiwei and on Pulo Condre. The Chinese and Viet inhabitants seem rather bemused by our presence but the accompanying police presence has quickly quelled any imagined action against the new administration."
tai.152.a:0 "Britainnia still rules the waves."
tai.152.b:0 "We are not Hong Kong, Remember that."

tai.153.t:0 "Britain Shoots Down South China Deal"
tai.153.d:0 "The British have shot down Taiwan's proposed trade deal. Citing concerns over Taiwan's ability to guarantee security in the region. In truth the British are wary of the Japanese and their intentions, maintaining a strong military presense north of Hong Kong is seen as a crucial defence mechanism against Japanese aggression in the Pacific. The Taiwanese delegation expressed disappointment but insisted that Anglo-Taiwanese relations were better than ever."
tai.153.a:0 "I guess they really want that Legation City."
tai.153.b:0 "I guess the Empire isn't as sick as they say."

tai.16.t:0 "Propose The Java Treaty"
tai.16.d:0 "Relations with the Dutch could be better, they could also be worse, as a former colony there is some history between our nations. That said the Dutch are a neutral party and stable Monarchy with strong economic resources in Indonesia. We both may benefit from an 'Exports-for-Rubber' trade deal that would boost both economies and allow us the material goods to make significant military defences."
tai.16.a:0 "Modern Materials For Modern Times."
tai.16.b:0 "Rubber For Car Tyres? Or Rubber For Bombers?"

tai.161.t:0 "Taiwan Proposes A Deal"
tai.161.d:0 "The Taiwanese, recently independent thanks to the Japanese collapse, have approached us with plans for a trade deal. Netherlands gets the economic benefits of Taiwanese exports, the Taiwanese in return have asked for a share in the rubber production of Indonesia."
tai.161.a:0 "Of course, we both stand to benefit."
tai.161.b:0 "No, there are more profitable customers."

tai.162.t:0 "Taiwan Strikes Deal with the Dutch"
tai.162.d:0 "The Dutch are eager to work with the few remaining democracies in the world and having a friend in asia could prove advantageous to them. So they have graciously accepted our offer and have agreed to a 15 year rubber export plan to Taiwan. In addition the Dutch have expanded their diplomatic and economic connections in Taipei, both the embassy and stock exchange now have expanded Dutch presence."
tai.162.a:0 "Welcome back old friend."
tai.162.b:0 "Hopefully they don't make us their Sinasappel again."

tai.163.t:0 "Netherlands Denies Rubber Trade"
tai.163.d:0 "The Dutch, ever protective over their Indonesian colony and its assets, have refused our offer, fearing communist subversion of Taiwan and subsequent revolution in their colony."
tai.163.a:0 "Darn it, we'll have to look to Indochina instead."
tai.163.b:0 "Darn it we'll have to pay the tariffs instead."

tai.17.t:0 "The Guam Agreement"
tai.17.d:0 "The United States economic predicament continues to damage their prestige and more importantly, ability to administer their pacific territories. With the military under pressure to keep costs down we have a tempting offer for the Yanks, we will offer to take control over Guam and the base there, in return the USA will become a cooperating miltary power and they will have permission to station troops in our territories, as well as the tempting offer of a trade deal to export goods to US markets, a potential stimulus to their economy that will be hard to turn down."
tai.17.a:0 "Hopefully they see the mutual benefit."
tai.17.b:0 "Hopefully they don't start to miss the island."

tai.171.t:0 "Taiwan Proposes A Deal"
tai.171.d:0 "The new democratic government of Taiwan has approached us with an offer, they have asked for us to hand the island of Guam over to them, in return for military cooperation and station rights, as well as a potentially lucrative import/export deal that could help us revitalize the economy."
tai.171.a:0 "A small price for economic stimuli."
tai.171.b:0 "We'll never cede an inch of American land."

tai.172.t:0 "Taiwan Strikes Deal with the USA"
tai.172.d:0 "The Americans have replied, after much deliberation they have accepted our deal and turned control of Guam over to a Taiwanese military attache. The trade deal has been signed and the goods are now flowing across the pacific."
tai.172.a:0 "I can see it now - 'Made in Taiwan' on American products."
tai.172.b:0 "Hopefully the Japanese navy don't mind the traffic."

tai.173.t:0 "America Dismisses Taiwan's Proposed Trade"
tai.173.d:0 "The Americans have replied, after much deliberation they have rejected our deal, citing the strategic importance of Guam to the Navy and their control over the Philipines."
tai.173.a:0 "Curse those fools."
tai.173.b:0 "Bless their hearts."

tai.18.t:0 "The Steel Deal"
tai.18.d:0 "Australia is an important steel producer for the Commonwealth, we should propose a steel trade deal with them, they sell us the raw materials and we sell them the products manufactured afterwards. Sure, some of the steel will make guns but we don't have to tell them that."
tai.18.a:0 "Send The Diplomats!"
tai.18.b:0 "Hopefully They Trust Our Intentions."

tai.181.t:0 "Taiwan Proposes Steel Deal"
tai.181.d:0 "The new government of Taiwan has approached us with a proposal for a share in the steel industry, the Taiwanese will recieve a share in Australian steel production and Australia will recieve low or tariff-free imports on Taiwanese goods."
tai.181.a:0 "Business is good."
tai.181.b:0 "There are more lucrative markets."

tai.182.t:0 "Taiwan Strikes Deal with Australia"
tai.182.d:0 "Australian and Taiwanese diplomats have signed a historic economic deal. Taiwanese trade in Australian Steel will now be much more lucrative and simplified. Lower tariffs and industrial investments will help boost the Australian production and Taiwanese industry."
tai.182.a:0 "More steel means more gunboats!"
tai.182.b:0 "The iron mongers lick their lips."

tai.183.t:0 "Australia Shoots Down Steel Deal"
tai.183.d:0 "The Australian delegation to Taiwan has reported the Canberra government has opted to priorities Commonwealth economic integration over investment in foreign markets. Sadly the deal has fallen through as a result."
tai.183.a:0 "How will we build our ships?!"
tai.183.b:0 "There are alternatives."

tai.19.t:0 "The Formosa Pact Signed"
tai.19.d:0 ""The Formosa Pact is a formal diplomatic guarantee of protection over Taiwan from the Dutch and British. Should the island be attacked the two will be obligated to defend her.
tai.19.a:0 "Taiwanese Never Ever Shall Be Slaves!"
tai.19.b:0 "Are We Trying To Annoy Tokyo?"

tai.20.t:0 "Pacific Trade Organisation Established"
tai.20.d:0 "The Pacific Trade Organisation or PTO is a formal guarantee of protection over Taiwan from the United States of America. It is also an economic and technological deal that will make Taiwan one of America's closest partners in Asia."
tai.20.a:0 "The Land of the Free and the Home of the Brave."
tai.20.b:0 "The Land of the Lap Dogs and the Home of the War Hawks."

tai.21.t:0 "Infiltrate the Cities"
tai.21.d:0 "In order to truly usurp the cliques work should begin on preparing People's Party loyalists and operatives in the major cities for revolution, if the right men and women can be found we can take over the show without a shot fired. Surely there are enoug dissatisfied police and administrators to facilitate such a power change."
tai.21.a:0 "This is the first step to uniting the nation."
tai.21.b:0 "Are we sure this is going to work?"

tai.22.t:0 "Infiltrate the Countryside"
tai.22.d:0 "Work has begun to agitate for defection to the People's party among the farmers of rural southern China. The emphasis on rebellion against Mandarin Imperialism and northern rule has struck a chord with some and the disenchanted who saw the revolution as a failure after the expedition. They now await the day that the People's Party calls them to arms against their masters."
tai.22.a:0 "We can't possibly lose if we control the food supply!"
tai.22.b:0 "We can't possibly win if they control the factories."

tai.23.t:0 "Cities in Revolt"
tai.23.d:0 "Urban areas across southern China have broken out in revolt against their local overlords. People's militias have been formed to defend them against retaliation and the warlords are now in a state of flux as their base support falls out from beneath them. It will take some time for Taiwan to secure control fully but soon a Republic of China will be established and the people of the south at least will be united at last."
tai.23.a:0 "The Revolution has begun!"
tai.23.b:0 "Another Revolution has begun..."

tai.231.t:0 "The Flag Flies!"
tai.231.d:0 "The TPP flag is raised across the cities! Across the KMT clqiues these upstarts are occupying China piece by piece."
tai.231.a:0 "The Revolution is inevitable."
tai.231.b:0 "Crush them!"
tai.231.c:0 "Conceed to the TPP's oversight."

tai.24.t:0 "Agricultural Workers take up Arms"
tai.24.d:0 "The farmers are rising up! At the signal of our infiltrators the people have taken up arms against the local leaders and placed TPP loyalists in power. These regions have large populations but no means of industry and so the require the cities to revolt as well to be supported. already a reaction from the KMT factions on the mainland is being organised, if we do not act quickly the revolution may be crushed."
tai.24.a:0 "The people take up arms!"
tai.24.b:0 "The people take pitchforks to rifles."

tai.241.t:0 "Country-Wide Defection"
tai.241.d:0 "The countryside with its many minor towns and villages is now awash with TPP loyalist leaders securing roads and bridges, as the militias assemble they guard the grain stores and crops that will fuel the revolution."
tai.241.a:0 "The Revolution is inevitable."
tai.241.b:0 "These traitors will be crushed."
tai.241.c:0 "Accept TPP Sovereignty."

tai.25.t:0 "Reactionary Organisations Shut Down"
tai.25.d:0 "The remanants of Japanese rule and notable religious radicals are a blemish on the new Taiwan. New regulations on religious activities have come into place that effectively make non-state-sanctioned faith practises illegal. Japanese-Taiwanese people have been placed under observation and the scant few monarchists have simply disappeared over night. New art works in the halls of the Chiayi Palace depict broken crowns and a good many Chrysanthemums aflame."
tai.25.a:0 "They were traitors all, let the past lie."
tai.25.b:0 "Many were patriots, but simply disloyal."

tai.26.t:0 "Socialist Organisations Shut Down"
tai.26.d:0 "The remains of the left-KMT on Taiwan have persisted as a thorn in the side of the PPP for long enough, subverting our rule with talk of proletarian revolution and their inisitent sino-philia has nauseated the leadership in towns and cities up and down the west coast. It is high time to rid ourselves of such subversive elements. Thus a grand operation to root out the leftists and make examples of their leaders has been put into action, thousands of Yellow-Jackets and Chi-Hsing Volunteer Soldiers have been organised into a 'Counter-Cultural Defence Division' with explicit orders to shoot known Communists and Socialist Leaders on sight, with arrest warrants on anyone found in locations known to be used for leftist gatherings. Within weeks Taiwan will have no leftists to speak of who aren't dead in a ditch or being re-educated as members of the Mason's corp building stone works and statues across the island."
tai.26.a:0 "They changed nothing, we are the future!"

tai.27.t:0 "PPP Purges Technocrats From Ranks"
tai.27.d:0 "Some among the KMT defectors to the PPP developed sympathies for the ideas of exiled Japanese technocrats. Acheiving a new future through appointing a technocratic government and placing sacreed importance on education is a seemingly innocuous vision to many. The party doesn't see it that way however, and now that the PPP's power has been consolidated, there is little need for such elitist ideas as these any longer. Beginning with impromptu party conferences across Taiwan, the technocratic ranks were quickly singled out and ejected from party grounds - directly into the arms of waiting Yellow-Jackets outside. Some of Taiwan's best and brightest have now been placed under house arrest and had their political powers stripped. A select few ring-leaders have disappeared entirely following the conferences, lending to rumours that many among the 'Clique of Elitist Traitors' have been murdered by the state. Adding to suspicions is the emergence of a new piece in the Chiayi Hall of Arts, a grand canvas adorned in Taiwanese characters written in a suspiciously blood-scented oil, the characters read 'The Future Belongs To Men Of Culture'."

tai.102.d:0 "In order to safeguard the revolution we should sign a formal alliance with our comrades in Japan. Their victory over the Imperials is yet another example of the power of the people and the destiny that awaits all of Asia. Taiwan will have it's role to play in this movement, between us in the South and Japan in the North, the revolution will be unstoppable. However, priorities and ambitions will have to be tempered as competing claims are worked out and the issue of potential allies in China is resolved."

tai.1021.d:0 "The Taiwanese have approached us with the offer of a formal alliance in the interest of bringing the revolution to the rest of Asia. While weak, the island will serve as an ideal invasion point for Southern China. With their addition to the Pacific Worker's League, we could realistically begin diplomatic expansion back into former imperial territories."

tai.1022.t:0 "Japan Accepts Petition"

tai.1023.d:0 "Japan has rejected our petition for alliance, this display of irridentist foolishness has damaged relations and set Japan on a path towards reconquering Taiwan. Why else would they reject our offer if not because they intend to invade? Truly the Revolution in Japan has already been betrayed."

tai.101.d:0 "Since the reactionaries cannot be defeated without co-operation from across the world, it is time for Taiwan to reach out to potential allies, whether fellow revolutionaries or allies of convenience who can be ideologically corrected later. The question is: shoudl Taiwan send a delegation to Germany and request our inclusion in the International, or should we form the New Revolutionary Front in Asia and seek the friendship of the left-KMT on the mainland?"

Recently arrived observers from the Acephalé and Escadron have sent comment back to Le Soleil of the novel phenomenon of Taiwanese Occidentalism, the grandeur of the halls of the Chiayi Governor's Palace and the efficacy of the Yellow Jackets. They have recommended that the French leadership send aid and advisors to Taiwan immediately, lest this fledgling example of acceleration in action be lost to reactionary and socialist forces in Asia."
