#EVENTS#
pcn.1.title:0 "Future of the Kongo"
pcn.1.desc:0 "Ernst Jünger has to pick a Prime Minister to function with him as President of the Prussian Kongo, and ensure that our colony has direction. Hans Huttig, the candidate of the white minority, is militaristic and violent, almost abusive towards his subordinates, but is an otherwise intelligent and powerful man. Louis Brody, the candidate of the natives and the educated blacks, is a Prussian celebrity born in Cameroon, that seeks to estabilish a welfare state in the Kongo. Who does Jünger pick?"
pcn.1.a:0 "Hans Huttig!"
pcn.1.b:0 "Louis Brody!"
pcn.2.title:0 "Protests by the Prime Minister"
pcn.2.desc:0 "Our Prime Minister believes that Jünger is far too moderate and that more direct action needs to be taken. They have been rallying protests from their support bases and Jünger now sits at a crossroads. What shall be done?"
pcn.2.a:0 "Louis Brody successfully coups the Government!"
pcn.2.b:0 "Hans Huttig rails the Militarists and coups Jünger!"
pcn.2.c:0 "Ernst Jünger beats back both Brody and Huttig by use of Askari guards!"
pcn.3.title:0 "Soccer Stadium Opened Up in Äquatorstadt"
pcn.3.desc:0 "A soccer stadium has been opened up by Dutch entrepeneurs in the capital of our Kongo, Äquatorstadt. We are excited to bring this sport to Africa and create our own football team, the Prussian Tigers."
pcn.3.a:0 "Hoorah! Prussian Tigers go!"
pcn.4.title:0 "Local village creates Prussian military rally"
pcn.4.desc:0 "A local village, patriotic as usual, has created a small Askari rally proclaiming us as the legitimate authority in the entire Kongo. This has boosted support among the countryside a little."
pcn.4.a:0 "They're good people."
pcn.5.title:0 "Forbidden Love?"
pcn.5.desc:0 "A couple has been seen in Äquatorstadt holding hands and kissing in public. The shocker? They were both boys! The two have been brought to court as there has been no precedent of this in our legal code, and they defend themselves by claiming it's only love. The prosecution claims they are destroying public morality and causing outrage. The final verdict is..."
pcn.5.a:0 "Not Guilty!"
pcn.5.b:0 "Guilty!"
pcn.6.title:0 "The Ultimatum"
pcn.6.desc:0 "Louis Brody has been faced with an ultimatum by the people around him - Shall he allow local tribal leaders to participate in a true democracy, or will he suspend democratic reforms to ensure westernism comes to the Kongo?"

pcn.6.b:0 "Louis Brody gives the people liberty."
