POLITICS_LAMPIAO_DESC:0 "Virgulino Ferreira da Silva, better known as Lampião, was born in Serra Talhada, Pernambuco, to a humble family of farmers, and became more and more disillusioned with the federal government after local coronéis killed one of his siblings in 1921, and ever since then became a violent cangaceiro, or bandit, dealing with the lawlessness in the area by making large amounts of money protecting cities and communities, and raiding government territory. With the 1935 Revolution in Brazil, Lampião already began hostile to the new administration, increasing his raids and eventually, with the appointing of policies that began destroying the cangaceiro way of life, he organized his forces and created a provisional territory in which the lawless and free life of the Northeast  can be preserved from egalitarian marxists."
