POLITICS_Xu_Chong_Zhi_DESC:0 "“They often say that Xu Chongzhi is negative, decadent and disappointing. It seemed to me that he was not so simple. There was a storm brewing in his heart, a storm strong enough to sweep across China.”——Mao Zedong\n\nXu Chongzhi was born in 1886 in Panyu, Guangdong province. He entered the Imperial Japanese Army Academy in 1903 and joined the TMH in 1906. After that, he assisted Sun Yat-sen in coordinating military affairs and became one of the main leaders of the Guangdong army, fighting north and south for the revolutionary cause. Later he participated in the Constitutional Protection Movement in accordance with Sun's will and made an indelible contribution to the establishment of Changsha National Government. Xu then led the National Revolutionary Army to pacify Guangzhou and became President of the Huangpu Military Academy in 1923.\n\nPeople have two different opinions on Xu's performance in the northern expedition. Some believe that he judged the situation and ordered a ceasefire in time to preserve the strength of the NRA and the spark of the revolution. Some people believe that Xu was the biggest traitor of the revolution. His weak character and frail willpower led to the failure of the northern expedition.\n\nAfter the Nanjing Conference, Chen Qimei could not bear to see a highly respected party elder sitting in Liangguang, Xu Chongzhi naturally became the governor of Guangdong province and became the nominally supreme dictator of Liangguang.  Xu Chongzhi, who was in his prime, was sitting in the power center of Liangguang, commanding the best army in China. Xu has not forgotten is to train the NRA day and night, and to lobby western powers to sell him weapons: he seems to promise that a well-equipped, well-trained army at his command will prevent another left-wing revolution in China. Or is he just waiting for a great man to make the final call......?"
