#LEADER DESCRITIONS#
UPI_brutal_colonizer:0 "Brutal Colonizer"
UPI_brutal_colonizer_desc:0 "A brutal man who would rather see a dozen dead over one protestor, it has become the speciality of Winston Churchill to put down the revolts of the United Provinces with violence instead of words."

UPI_winston_churchill:0 "The man responsible for butchery in Gallipoli, where ANZAC forces were gunned down for no gain. The tyrant behind the chemical weapons used in the Middle East. The dictator of India, where entire villages vanish. Winston Churchill is a broken man, who cannot stand the blood he drowns in every day. What will happen to poor Winston? He is propelled forwards by nothing but the expectation that more pain-dulling whiskey is on the horizon, not seeing the knives sharpening around him."

UPI_avatar_desc:0 "No one knows where this bold, charismatic woman came. She came chanting, she came shouting, she came telling the Indians that they had stumbled upon divine truths. Over time, a mess, a total and complete mess of pseudo-religion, ideology, a personality cult, and ultimately just thousands of people needing some manifestation of hope to cling to. This exploitation of fear, anger, and hate, with a veneer of justification in mis-remembered and outright lied-about theology, became the Avatar Cult, lead by a Goddess who shall drown the world in blood."

UPI_alone_unsupplied_cutoff:0 "Alone, Unsupplied and Cut-off"
UPI_alone_unsupplied_cutoff_desc:0 "We are relying more and more on internal manufacture, and the high-quality Lee-Enfields our soldiers are used to are slowly being replaced by home-grown gun designs. Manufacturing problems aside, they're often nowhere near as well-liked."

UPI.1.t:0 "The First Letter"
UPI.1.desc:0 "“Dearest Lord of the Admiralty, Duke Winston Churchill, \n\n I hope this letter finds you in ill health. Because of your choices in the battles of Gallipoli, I have lost three children. Joshua, Frank, and Harvey lay not in their beds, warm and safe, but under the dunes of the Turkish lands, because of you. I understand that war will result in death, and when my boys went to war, I was perhaps naïve in believing that they would all return safe. But as more details of the blunders that lead to their demises emerged, as your buffoonery and incompetence became more clear, I realize now that they would be a thousand times better in Ypres or the Somme than under your command in the Dardanelles. \n\n I know now that their fates were preventable, if only they had been sent to East Africa, against the Askari, or if they had found themselves knee-deep in the mud of France. How pitiful, that I wish for them to have suffered so, for otherwise they would not have died. Perhaps they could have done many great things. I know that Harvey always enjoyed cooking – perhaps he was his company’s in-field chef before the shells fell. Perhaps there are poems, lost in those dunes, that my Joshua wrote. I won’t know, now. May you never again sleep peacefully, for I have not. \n\n Yours, Mary Williamson” \n\n Dated January 3rd, 1920. Churchill took another long swig of whiskey, and tried to fold it up, throw it into the fire, as he had some few other letters of its type. And yet, he could not."

UPI.2.t:0 "The Second Letter"
UPI.2.desc:0 "“It has become apparent that, due to the shortcomings in strategy and a lack of results, that Sir Winston Churchill, Lord of the Admiralty, is deeply incompetent. After repeated mistakes in the assaults on the Dardanelles, including the complete misjudging of the situation regarding mines, the safety of the soldiers to land, and the lack of artillery support provided, despite no less than five battleships being within firing range, resulting in nearly a hundred-thousand casualties within the first four days  of landing, the only course that can be reasonably seen that Churchill is a liability in this role.” \n\n Attached to the back, was the official letter, telling Winston in plain terms that there was little more that could be said, and that the King has officially revoked his role as Lord of the Admiralty. This, he thought, was a memento mori. Not for himself, no. The skull on his table, its phrenological markings a newer addition to the dusty thing, was reminder enough of looming death. This was the death-memory of a career, a career which flung itself into wild adventures it was not ready for. He would never, never, repeat the mistake of Gallipoli, never again send men into the fray without deep, careful consideration. \n\n Assuming he could actually get out of this damned place."

Instead, you shall be given a place in the colonies of the British Empire. You may, if you wish, accept a position in the British Raj, as the governor of the province of Lucknow.” \n\n The rest of the letter wasn’t terribly important. It was, however, everything to Churchill. Looking at it all, looking at where his life went. Accepting a role in India. After Kurdistan. After Gallipoli. After so much death, destruction, and horror wrought in the name of the British Empire, it was still willing to use him somewhere. Perhaps that was a good sign, or perhaps they understood the impending collapse of the Raj, and hoped he would die in the ensuing fights. \n\n But he had kept a stiff upper lip, and survived. And he would keep doing so."

Where, once, it was called ‘mouthwash’ for its tiny amount of whiskey, it was now as much whiskey as it was soda. Some days, he just wanted it undiluted. \n\n “Enter,” mumbled Churchill. “Leave it by the bed,” he gestured to his side, where he had scarcely woken up before having his breakfast. Of the few perks this post had, getting breakfast in bed was an undeniable one. He picked up the crystal glass, swirled it around, pretending to care about taste and smell before gulping down the drink. The maid watched, her mouth agape in horror at the wreck of a man before her. \n\n “Well? Do you have something to say?” He growled, noticing her worry. \n\n “Well, sir, I don’t mean to be rude…” He waited. She waited. The air felt tight. Like before a battle, before the first shot was fired. “But the maids and I…have wondered if you could…ease back on the alcohol? It can’t be heal—” \n\n A solid half-pound of crystal glass smashed into her eye. She let out a scream, blood streaming from her split eyelash.

His Enfield-Martini, one of the better rifles someone could get in this god-forsaken, sun-blasted hell, was clean and well-maintained. A model soldier. Churchill gave a half-hearted salute back. \n\n “I must remind you, sir, as you requested me to, that there will be a military parade in the courtyard. And while my place is not to judge nor command, sir, I must insist on behalf of Colonel Randal that you attend – sun would do you good, he said. Sir.” \n\n Churchill paused for a moment, looking over the guard. Frowning, he asked the man for his name. \n\n “Sir, I am Private George Statham.” \n\n “A private? Let me tell you, young man, that you are never to speak to me of such matters again,” he spat. \n\n “Sir, I am merely—” \n\n “Yes, I know, you’re following orders. Let me give you new ones – get your pale, unbloodied ass out on to the streets of Lucknow for a day. Then you’ll know why I don’t go outside. Tell your commander you are dismissed from the guard, and to be reassigned to military police. My orders.” \n\n “But, sir!” \n\n “Go!”"

UPI.6.desc:0 "The raindrops splashed furiously on the floor, the only sound in the otherwise silent palace. \n\n “Maybe the rain could help me think,” thought a disorientated and drunken Churchill looking through the window. The old Viceroy was baffled. He was sure that he went to the library for something but he couldn’t remember what it was. Maybe he just went to grab a book? Some of the old wisdom from Smith would be useful to put the Raj back on track. Maybe some of the classics from Shakespeare could be helpful to alleviate his insomnia. Maybe he just went for to drink a whisky on his comfy chair? Well, he could drink, and had drank on every chair the house. \n\n Or maybe he just went to take a look at the reports over his table since he had nothing to do. Anything was possible at that point. \n\n “I think I should go to bed” decided Churchill. The loud noises of his slippers on the carpet from his heavy feet filled him with a feeling of ennui. He felt like each one of his 61 years was coming to him with every step. The old man wished to recover that enthusiasm he had when he proposed that foolish Gallipoli operation. Even the most resonating of failures would fill him of more life than his current depressing situation."

After many bottles, after many cigars, after lively debate, and not a small amount of requests he ‘sleep it off,’ Churchill has seen that there’s only three paths left for him. Four, if you count ‘shoving a gun down my throat and pulling the trigger.’ But as that is off the table, three it is. \n\n First, he can go forwards as he had before, attempt to contact Britain. It will require just a little bit of shoving people out of the way, but it is entirely possible. He could do it. Just…get past those socialist warlords in Bihar, and taste the salt of the sea once more. Yes, yes he could do that. He could do that. \n\n Next, he could double down. Become worse. If the Indians are already putting up posters declaring his monsterhood, then he could very well become a monster. Order, at all costs. Order, in all times. Reunite the provinces of India, form a new Raj, one that could last a thousand years, as long as Britain, until every trace of this disgusting continent is gone, and all that is left is a Britain he loves. \n\n Or…or he could be a politician again. The warlord life never suited him. No, he loves democracy too much, he loves freedom too much, to think about being a warlord. Introduce reforms, install a new electoral system. If he will create a new Raj, it will be through peace. If he creates a new Raj, it could be with words, not weapons. \n\n But which way forwards? Which way?"

No, the Indians were merely uneducated, untaught, uncouth people – and people like that couldn’t be too terribly different from the impoverished Smoggies his fellows would court for election. \n\n No, if he was making any mistake, it was that these Indians were yearning to breathe free, yearning for democracy and peace and, above anything, the old values he once held as a British citizen, as a British politician. Yes, indeed, what these Indians needed was not the firm hand of dictatorship, but the gentle, paternal hand of a democracy!

Part of his liberalization reforms.” \n\n “What, so when a bunch of thugs come and wanna gut me for fucking with them a few weeks ago, I just stand there and get shanked?” \n\n “No, you call for help, idiot.” The chief crossed his arms, glaring at the officer. “Your entire job is to protect and serve the people of our nation, not shoot and plunder the people.

The census officer moved from house to house, hoping that egg didn’t pelt him when people saw the Churchill badge on his breast. \n\n He approached one small, adobe hut, the type of hut that didn’t house anyone of importance, the type of hut you expect Dalits to huddle inside and wait for an inevitable end, but he still had to mark them down, as useless as they were. He knocked on the door, and waited. A woman opened the door, and welcomed him in, noticing the badge on his breast. The moment he was in, he felt the atmosphere tense up, tighten. A man sat in a chair, his eyes covered by bandages, his body covered in the scars of chlorine gas. The woman spoke up. \n\n “May I help you?”"

Yes, I shall rule until then, but if the Indian people do not want me, they shall toss me out! That is how it works in lands of civilization, and I will make India a land of civilization!” \n\n “Of course, sir. I simply suggested that...that maybe you should wait a bit? I do not know if the Indian people a-are ready for this.” \n\n “You have a low opinion of your own people. Regardless, get me some whiskey. I’m certain this will all turn out well, I just need some of the thinker’s spark.” \n\n The maid complied, hiding in her heart a thousand insults.

Lowering his head, he let the barrage of questions continue. Questions that he knew...at their core...were just questions. Proper questions. What anyone sane would ask.

We wish your nation-building well. But we cannot aid you.” \n\n “W-wait!” Churchill stammered, for the first time in his living memory, he was at a loss for words, he couldn’t find what else to say. “I’m changing.” \n\n “Change is well and good, Churchill. But it won’t bring back the dead.” \n\n The man was right. There was no way around it – Winston, for all his preaching of democracy, was little better than the worst Oriental dictator.

I stopped the nationalists from gutting your power, I stopped the savage and uneducated from determining their own fate, and took your council always. I will continue to do so as I rule, I will continue to see you as equals, as nobles and aristocrats in a world increasingly hostile to our kind.” Those leaders of the Princely states all nodded in agreement, murmuring among themselves that Churchill had, for his faults, done more for them than they could expect from the liberals or social democrats, or the socialists to the West should the instability allow them to step in. And so, once Churchill’s speech was done, the old money and entrenched power of the Princely states backed him wholeheartedly."

They're quickly being pushed back by our forces, our borders are secure, and the dangerous, despotic ideas these people share will not infest our nation.\" \n\n But nobody listened to the ramblings of the old Viceroy. Life was going as usual for the Indians and they were probably listening to music or sports on their radios instead of him. Chruchill was aware of this. He collected his thoughts for a second and decided to end the broadcast early\": he wasn't in the mood to talk to no one right now. \n\n "God save... the King" stuttered Churchill before emptying the whole content of the glass in one shot."

Many of them still had the scars of chlorine gas burns, the last words of friends who choked on mustard gas were fresh in their minds as this man, this insane man who supported a brutal colonizer, decided to stroll in and extoll the virtues of Churchill’s conservatism, of his reasonability, of his love for India. This man, this man who dared to enter a village where the bodies were still fresh, this man who thought he and his entire leadership are beyond consequences, this man who decided to make everything about him, and not to even once consider where he was going...\n\n It enraged the people, stirred up every hateful thought, every word of freedom, every single desire they had to be free from the yoke of Churchill, all exploded and enflamed, and he didn’t understand their hate as he was hung.

After what seemed like hours, but was probably more like fifteen minutes, he was shuffling towards his closet, and put on a bath robe. He tied the belt a little too tight, but that didn’t matter. It was time for him to begin his day. A quick glance at the clock told him it was 1 PM. \n\n Time for lunch, though the nicotine craving he developed long ago gnawed at his stomach all the same as hunger.

If it really bleeds you to serve a man cold food, then you can tell him he has to wait.” The threat of dissapointing Churchill was enough to discourage the aide from further questions. She nodded quietly, and scurried off before the one-eyed maid got angry at her. \n\n Bacon, eggs, toast, and a heady glass of white wine, along with coffee if the supplies held. Luckily, today they had. He sat there, munching away at the food, considering what next would happen today."

It wasn’t long until someone, the newest hire, walked into the room, bowing deeply, and asked him if he needed anything. \n\n “Another cigar, please. It seems as though this box,” he held up the small carton and shook it. “Is empty.” The maid nodded and went to get another box. Churchill relaxed, his fix of nicotine soon to be brought over. \n\n “Sir,” the contrite maid said upon her return. “I could not find any cigars. Not in the humidifier, not in the storage, not in your personal storage, none in the officer’s quarters either. There is not a single cigar in this palace.” \n\n “Like hell there isn’t!” Churchill roared, standing upright, wobbling as all the blood rushed to his head. \n“Search harder, search more!”"

Instead, as he grabbed another sandwich from the lazy susan, he motioned the one-eyed maid over. \n\n “Can you bring me some more wine?” He murmured. She nodded, trying not to look directly into Churchill’s eyes, hoping he didn’t see the fear in her own. \n\n The trip down to the wine cellar was a horror movie, as the creaking stairs and cobwebs became her only companion. She turned a corner, and started perusing the wine. There was none. Every bottle was gone. Fear and panic shot through her as she raced to find some way to explain to Sir Churchill that there simply wasn’t any wine left. What happened, where did it go? She could have sworn there was a new shipment in last week, but then Churchill had held that party with his officers. Did he drink it all already? Did some sly officer steal it? \n\n She ventured back upstairs, shaking as she approached Sir Churchill. \n\n “S-sir, there is no more wine.” \n\n There was silence, tense silence, as Churchill contemplated this. \n\n He slammed his fist down on to the table, and told her to get out, shouted to be left alone. She didn’t need much convincing, soon running to her quarters."

UPI.37.desc:0 "“You are all doing a wonderful job,” Churchill said to the officers gathered before him, before ordering three more bottles of wine to be brought over. Of the twenty men, his closest friends and companions in this trying time, fifteen were piss-drunk, two were sober, two were only mildly buzzed, and one was passed out on the table, a puddle of spittle slowly growing from the cavernous source that was his mouth. \n\n “I have read all your reports, of course,” Churchill lied. “And I have come to the conclusion that we are making progress. While there have been some setbacks in the pacification efforts, it really is quite wonderful to see the progress we have made in Lucknow proper. I greenlight all your proposals.” \n\n This was problematic, given half of them didn’t remember their proposals, and the other half of them contradicted each other. But the officers weren’t drunk to celebrate. They were drunk to tolerate their monthly meeting with Churchill. To an extent, Churchill knew this. But he didnt’ care - the officers knew how to work among themselves, to work towards Churchill. It didn’t matter how productive the meetings were, they were formalities. The officers really ran the show, and Churchill thought that suited him just fine."

UPI.38.t:0 "Food Shortages"
UPI.38.desc:0 "The farmers of the United Provinces have been a constant source of pain and agony for the regime. Not only do they not produce as much as they’re instructed to, but what they do produce is often stashed and hidden away. No matter how many police are brought in, no matter how grandiose the threats of violence are, and no matter how harshly those threats are enacted, the Lucknow police and Churchill’s army cannot dislodge the rice from the farmers. Promises of payment don’t work - the farmers have been burned before. Threats of violence don’t work - it’s not like the farmers would be free from harm if they handed the crops over. It’s a problem many in the regime believe insurmountable. This has had many, many, consequences, chief among them that famine perpetually looms over the United Provinces. Unless something changes soon, the people of Lucknow will starve."
UPI.38.a:0 "We still have enough rice, right?"

UPI.39.t:0 "Food Riots"
UPI.39.desc:0 "“We need food!” Was the simple, constant, chant of desperate people. It filled the streets of Lucknow, it filled the throats of the population when rice did not. As the rationing was imposed, a mere handful of rice was what they were expected to eat each day, barely enough to sustain an invalid, a prisoner who never moves, let alone people who work every day. Children were sickly, the elderly were already half-starved, the hunger gnawed at the entire city. If there wasn’t relief soon, then the riot would become a full on revolution. The Officers of the United Provinces watched over them all, trying to decide their course of action."
UPI.39.a:0 "Damn it all."

UPI.40.t:0 "Shoot the Starving"
UPI.40.desc:0 "“Form rank!” Shouted the officer, raising his sword in the air. The three rows of soldiers organized themselves. The first row took aim before the command was even given. The protestors weren’t in full riot, in fact, many of them were standing arm-in-arm with each other, silent, not moving forwards. They were daring the soldiers to shoot. \n\n There wasn’t much left for them to lose - when their relatives had been disappeared, when their families had been held under the yoke of oppression, never knowing when they’d be targeted for sedation, for counter-regime activities, for merely being too rich-looking for some Anglo-Indian’s taste. If they died, then they would die proving to all India that Churchill was not a friend to India, was a man to be resisted at all costs, as they were doing here and now."

No one was willing to give up the fight, not now, not when home meant death by slow, agonizing starvation. The officers felt, as the masses of Indians, many thin from lack of food, others wild-eyed with desperation, pangs of fear, guilt, desperation just the same as the Indians they were told to kep under control. \n\n But their duty was their duty. When they did not disperse, the crowd was forced away. Squads of police and army-men, with clubs and nightsticks, beat away the protestors, breaking bones and shattering skulls. At the end of the day, seventy-five of the rioters, whose sole desire was to have a day’s worth of rice, lay dead, and hundreds more crawled back home to bleed."

UPI.42.desc:0 "Winston lounged on his sofa for an hour or two at a time, slipping between various states of conciousness, sleep, and the annoying half-way point where you could still sense the world around you, but couldn’t actually act. He hated the last one most of all. Reminded him too much of being awake, without the ability to drink to soften the blows. But today was a lazy day, a lazy day like any other lazy sunday. Nothing to worry about, nothing to concern himself with, the one day he would declare was solely for him, and him alone. A critic could charge that it wasn’t exactly much different from every other day, but Churchill had long ago purged the critics, moving them to low-level positions where he wouldn’t be bothered by them."

UPI.43.t:0 "What is it?!"
UPI.43.desc:0 "Knock, knock, knock. \n\n Winston tumbled off his sofa, trying to stand upright and proper as he went to the door. \n\n Knock, knock, knock. \n\n This had better be important, Churchill thought to himself as he grasped the doorknob. \n\n Knock, knock, knock! \n\n He swung open the door. An officer, no, a field marshal, field marshal Dyer, was standing there, his face covered in sweat and his expression transfixed in fear. \n\n “Sir,” he said. “It’s urgent.”"

Get the gas out, get the gas out and shell the villages until the villages get these upstart ring-leaders to stop! If that doesn’t work, beat the hell out of any Indian who looks at you funny. This isn’t a difficult thing to sort out.” \n\n The officers, not wanting to contradict Churchill, perhaps out of a misplaced loyalty to him or perhaps because they were too tired to argue, nodded. \n\n “Gas will quell any uprising with far less casualties than any other method. You all know this. So why have you not gone and done it yet!” \n\n One by one, the men left, wringing their hands with uncertainty towards their orders."

UPI.45.desc:0 "“We don’t have the resources, we don’t have the means to obtain resources, and we don’t have the loyalty of the people to secure the means,” Churchill said grimly. “We are, simply put, stuck in a deep hole with no way to get out. No way, except through grit, determination, and plans that I am drafting with some very close advisors of mine.” The field marshals looked at each other, wondering who could be closer to Churchill than them, save perhaps the whiskey bottle. \n\n “I expect your men to be in top shape, to be ready to fight more than starved Indians.” \n\n With that ominous message, Churchill left."

UPI.46.t:0 "Drills"
UPI.46.desc:0 "“Load, aim, fire!” Shouted the drill-master, treating everyone in the squad as if they had the same gun - namely, the worst gun of the lot. One of the soldiers was lucky enough to have a Lee-Enfield, but he wasn’t allowed to load the magazine. Instead, he needed to load each bullet, one at a time, before shooting, to keep pace with his fellows. He felt stifled, like he had been lead astray by the man who sold him the Lee. Of course, if he was unfortunate, then say nothing of Charles, the poor bastard, whose reproduction Martini-Henry that he got ‘for real cheap’ exploded in his face. \n\n The drills had gone successfully though. The group of ten men had been able to, before they were reduced to nine, average twelve shots in sixty seconds. Not awful, but not great either. Much better than before, though, their average of 6 shots in the same amount of time. Accuracy was going up, too. They were becoming a fighting force, no doubt about it. \n\n The artillery corps still unnerved the soldier, though. They were always firing, never quiet, and the place they were in had started to smell quite a bit like a pool back home. Whatever were the leaders planning?"
UPI.46.a:0 "Poor Charles, hope he can still serve after he recovers."

UPI.47.t:0 "The Old Dog's Got His Bite Back!"
UPI.47.desc:0 "“Bihar, gentlemen,” Churchill said. “Bihar’s warlords have ownership of a sea route. They have ownership of resources, food, guns, factories, we can use. They aren’t close to the Madras presidency, which is good.” \n\n “Why, sir? Wouldn’t it be easier to plunge through the south and connect with the Madras presidency?” \n\n “No. The last thing I want is a British soldier dead by my hand. We go through Bihar, and we will make certain that the Madras presidency will not come into conflict with us through mistaken identity.” He spoke with a candor that hadn’t been seen in Churchill in years. Confidence in himself, like he knew what he was doing. It wasn’t certain if he actually did know what he was doing, but the potential was there, and that alone was enough for many to conclude that the Old Dog had, indeed, gotten its bite back."

But it existed, and its local gunsmiths would show off their wares to everyone and anyone. They didn’t discriminate between an Indian who worked for Churchill, or an Indian who wanted to murder Churchill. \n\n But when Churchill’s men came en masse, it was easy to see why many were concerned, afraid even, of their coming. But instead of trying to seize the firearms, instead of trying to steal things, the men came with goods from Lucknow. Nothing fancy - steel and alcohol (mostly the stuff even Churchill thought too disgusting to touch, but alcohol nonetheless), silks and brass and gold, things pillaged from the palace and pilfered from the public. \n\n The gunsmiths showed off their wares, the highest quality to the lowest grade, and tested each gun before accepting payment, as requested. A few fingers were lost, but in the end, thousands of guns were taken out of Doon, and brought into the United Province’s Provisional Armed Forces."

Now, he had his eyes on the beautiful, jade-green waters of the Indian ocean.

The greatest benefit that taking Bihar had granted was that those bastards were hiding more than enough liquor to drown Churchill in. \n\n “What’s wrong, kid?” Churchhill chuckled. “Can’t you handle a few upstarts?” He could guess what the soldier was going to say.

As the night wore on, as countless battles between protestors and police were won and lost by each side, the orders came down from Churchill - it was time to bring out the big guns. \n\n Specifically, the Vickers guns. The rat-atta-atta of heavy machine guns, a sound any veteran of the Great War was familiar with, drowned out the chants and the riots, as thousands were wounded, gunned down, their lives cut short. \n\n Churchill watched, a dour expression on his face, as the fires burned. \n\n This would require steep punishment."

Curfew was imposed last night, yes, but certainly the soldiers would understand if he wanted to light his oven at the same time he did every day. Some of them were locals, or had lived here long enough to be called locals, and most of them had eaten his breads with their curries anyways. Certainly, that meant some leniancy.

What would happen to all the china and crystal glass? \n\n Regardless, he ordered the attack. It started within the hour - gas, shrapnel, whatever they could use to punish the Indians, all rained down on his own capital. If this didn’t bring peace, then nothing would. If this didn’t show he had everything in control, nothing would. This was desperate, yes, this was desperate, and his generals had pushed back, but what did they know? What did they know about war?

The villagers reported to their leader that Churchill had been found and killed, and it was shortly thereafter that all hell really broke loose. \n\n In Lucknow, where the bodies had still yet to be cleaned up, people struggled for control of key industrial points, for the water supplies, for the administrative palace, for every scrap of land there could be. In the villages, people prepared raids against percieved enemies. The battle for the United Provinces, for Uttar Pradesh, had begun. \n\n Churchill’s empire had fallen, and with it, India’s future had become a little less certain."

On the strange cults of India, on the supreme physicality of the Englishman, on the justification of Imperialism, for it was England’s birthright to go across the world, and bring the world culture and light. \n\n Churchill read, and read, and read some more, well into the early hours of the morning. It wasn’t until he was told that breakfast was ready that he stopped reading, and soon afterwards, he slept, ruminating on what he had read."

And Churchill, despite his...sordid position, demands to have and maintain power. So that old Italian Machiavelli seems as good a place as any, perhaps with older texts too, by philosopher-Kings and those who seemed to have a good head on their shoulders. \n\n Even engaging in a bit of self-flagellation, Churchill read reports from battle, from generals, how the British engaged in discipline and combat.

Eventually, they all quieted down and just listened to his ideas. \n\n Not all of them were convinced, in fact, at best only two walked away with grins on their faces. The others, the generals, the colonels, they stared at each other, cognizant of, and yet refusing to openly acknowledge, the butcher’s work in front of them.

Everything that he did was done to preserve England, to preserve Britain and its hegemony over the world. \n\n Those who could not see it did not deserve to be called Englishmen, and yet they infested the ranks of the British Empire. That is why he was abandoned, certainly. That is why he was left longing for his old home.

What is there, beyond philosophy, that can compel more tears in men and spawn more beauty in the world? That, my dear reader, is simple - the recognition of duty. Every man and woman has a duty in the world - set upon them by their race, their creed, their ideologies. Many of these duties are tempting, false ideas. One merely must look at the Bolsheviks and their failed uprising to see that. No, duty is something that runs deeper, much deeper than that.” \n\n “Whereas the French, seemingly, have abandoned the principles that so long ago made their country a threat to the British Empire, and the Russians have clung to the haggard hopes that obedience to some power shall keep them strong, and the Americans fall deeper into the perverse belief in the market, I come with something stronger. Something more powerful. What has united the great Empires throughout history, of course, is not clinging to one’s self, not clinging to one’s family, but to have a great calling to advance, to bring about change, to free those less fortunate from the squalor and filth they rot in. This is why the Englishman is in India. This is why the Englishman is right to be in India. This is what our duty is - to free those who are less unfortunate. They can never be of us, nor shall we ever be of them, but what beauty is there in giving them something greater to aspire to? They may protest, and claim we are murderers. We are murderers of the past, killers of the rot, purgers of those who would rather be free in filth than slaves in civilization.” \n\n “Where they claim to have built great structures, we shall tear down these edifices. Where they claim to have produced wondrous art, we shall burn their maggot-eaten tomes. All that they are is unworthy, it is our duty to show them.”"

As more of Lucknow’s native people came, more of the men from afar gathered too, until outright brawls were breaking out across Lucknow. \n\n The rioters shouted and screamed at the British men, demanding food for their bellies and for the chains of British rule to be removed. It wasn’t long until the soldiers, almost mechanically, almost without thinking, formed lines to fire. Without orders, they did what they were expected, and opened fire. Churchill watched the scene from afar, seeing not two groups of people, but two masses of meat combatting each other, a nameless horde trying to tear apart his vision. He cared little for the Indians - it was their fault for having such large families, it was their fault for trying to encroach on the rightful ruler’s property. It was their fault, it had to be."

After arguing for days, maybe even weeks (the alcohol had not helped his memory), he finally relented with his officers. A compromise to be reached, about their manpower supply. Recruiting from the native population, if they were willing. Subordinated, always, to an Englishman. But that different in a few ten-thousands of men, that would be enough to turn the tide for him in any battle. If they were fodder, it was a sacrifice he was willing to make.

The soldier had none of it, and shoved him aside. It was an old carpenter’s shop, the smell of sawdust still thick in the air. The man hadn’t worked for years, it was his son who had done most everything, his son who only a fortnight ago had gone missing. He thought, for just a second, that the soldiers storming it had something to do with it.\n“Your benefactor and Governor, Winston Churchill, has decreed that your shop shall serve the Colonial Army of India. Failure to do so will result in your arrest for treason. Do you understand me?”\n\n He did not, no more than he understood the letter he found this morning, or the voice of his friends.

He didn’t think he could trust them, the rank and file of a people who still clung on to ideas like ‘freedom’ and ‘independence.’ They seemed suspect, and they likely viewed him the same way.\n\n But with a bright, beaming, young Englishman at the head of each battalion, he felt that disquiet fade away. The British had done this so many times before, hadn’t they? In Africa, in the Americas, in India before the collapse, the use of such collaborators was commonplace. So long as they were fed and watered and rested, they would be soldiers. And that was all they needed to be.\n\n As he walked past them, he tried to ignore the unmistakable scowl of some, but they got to him, reminding him each time he spotted them that they would never truly, never fully, understand his designs. But, towards the end of his walk, he felt something...something he would never admit to himself."

One of the ones that...encouraged people to sign up for that murderer’s army. I didn’t think anyone would see me, but there was a fucking guard patrol passing by right as I stuffed the remains down a chamberpot.” \n\n “That’s it? Pathetic,” laughed the scarred man. “Churchy’s getting afraid, isn’t he? I got in here for putting up counter-posters...two years ago. Denouncing his rations and all that. Told people in my marketplace to rise up, refuse service to his soldiers. We could have stopped this then, but…” \n\n He sighed. “The man’s getting scared. And scared men hate thoughts that contradict their own.” \n\n “What do we do now?” \n\n “Fuck, there isn’t much to do, is there? Sit, rot, wait until they decide we’re in the yard getting shot.

Grandmothers, brothers, sons, mothers, all of them had been taken away by this bastard and his army. All of them had suffered, lost food, had their meals taken from their mouths and their families subject to horrid affairs. Disappeared family and friends, arrested co-workers, shot neighbors. \n\n It was inevitable that such cruelty would foment resistance, and they were just one group, waiting to extract their revenge and hurt Churchill, just a tiny bit. Even if it was a few dead men, it was something, some tiny toll extracted from him in penance for his own cruelty. \n\n At long last, the group of five soldiers came down the dirt road, talking to each other about the different ways you could use tonic water so it wouldn’t taste like shit. The ambushers put their rifles to their guns, hiding in the shadow of the forest, and as soon as they had their targets, pulled the triggers."

Everything would be fine - the soldiers here were protecting him, making sure he was safe. No need to fear such disorganized rabble, right? \n\n The aide was silenced by a bullet slamming into his skull, through one end and out the other, and ramming into Churchill’s breast pocket. Blood splattered across his face, seeped through the jacket. He could only grumble out an order to ‘floor it!’ as the car picked up speed, drove through the streets with little regard for safety.

We don’t mean to trouble you, but the generals told us you needed to know some things before you came back to Delhi.” \n\n “Oh, Christ,” he groaned. “What happened?” \n\n “The riots there have been put down successfully - it took a lot of bullets, and we lost a few hundred good men, but they’re down. Many of the local police services were helpful, as were the Native regiments, who we half-suspected armed your attempted assassin, but there’s little evidence to suggest that. We replaced the commanders anyways, just to be safe.” A coy smirk on the sitting soldier’s face told Churchill exactly what had been meant by “replaced.” \n\n “It’s safe to return, and can I just say, sir...”"

The executed man often begs for his life, but most of our men do not speak their language. It is easier when that’s the case. Pull the trigger, see them slump. Untie them. Bring in the next batch. Over, and over, and over. It is difficult, yes, and many men take to drinking to sooth their agonized hearts. Remind them this is correct.

Entire departments, if need be, have been reassigned or punished as seen fit. It was a blow to manpower, yes, and definitely upset some of the higher ups, but it had to be done. \n\n Churchill wanted more people to help keep order - the natural result of that was to hire criminals, to replace people he could with men willing to do the job.

No police officer could now say “the chief said we couldn’t,” because he was telling them now that they could. \n\n English as the sole language across the territory - speak whatever you wish at home, but to any official, it had to be English. Close watch on everyone, ensure everyone and everything was kept an eye on. More people brought into the force, requirements dropped. If you could hold a gun, you could protect India.

Rebelliousness grows like a weed, and merely removing the stem does not stop its roots from growing. It is, of course and always, a matter of force and power. This is something he’s learned over the years, this is something he’s been made to face in the last few years, and it’s something he will, without a single moment’s hesitation, apply now.

The first reaction, of course, is to breath in and out, to try to and purge the smell in some way. But it doesn’t work like that. The first breath you take, everything hurts. Hydrochloric acid forms in your lungs, on your eyes, in the mucus tissues of your mouth and nose. Pain forces you to the ground, and you breath in more. And more. And more. Until you drown in your own agony, dribbling foamed blood from the mouth. It takes only a few men to condemn thousands to a horrid, slow, death.

Churchill’s voice is commanding and calm, telling the people of India exactly what they want to hear. His words are precisely chosen, his methods of delivery, even on the audio-only media, are remarkable. \n\n Of course, how much truth he bends, how much he needs to assure them that they are reaping the fruits of their own hard labour, and other such things, are of little concern. As a family sits down for dinner, as the husband opens a bottle of wine and insists the radio is turned on, they hear an official congratulations to him, telling the entire world how excellent he is in the conduct of his duties, how the soldiers of his battalion have praised him so admirably. The husband freezes, and asks the wife to shut it off. \n\n The family eats in silence, understanding that this commendation, while meant in good faith and cheer by the Governor, has just done something unspeakable.

They need not be willing to join us, they need only be scared of us. \n\n Sent to the front lines, in vast hordes, with whatever bribery or threat is needed to force them into the field - families being threatened is a particularly effective option, the unwilling have been made useful as a sheer wave, as a soaking cloud of bodies that overrun and destroy. Many break and run, only to be trampled by the force of the wave. Many are shot no matter if their back is towards or away from the enemy, and once in the battle’s thickest point, everyone becomes a murderer."

UPI.90.desc:0 "Every last collaborator with Churchill has been rounded up, shot, butchered with machetes, whatever method available to us has been used and whatever plea they screeched has been silenced. Sacrifices were herded up, butchered, in the ecstasy of death and destruction there were even cannibals in our ranks, urged on and cheered on for their devotion to annihilative destruction! There is no one left to oppose us - India shall be ours, and the world shall experience the cleansing in flame that the Avatar has proclaimed!"

UPI.600.desc:0 "The letter was simple as it sat on the PM’s desk. It contained a lot of fluff, but the basic gist was obvious. \n\n “After securing control of India, save the Madras presidency, his Honourable Winston Churchill wishes for an envoy to come to India and examine his rulership of the nation, and if God is willing, to join the British Empire once more.” A simple request, a simple letter, and a hard choice."

UPI.601.t:0 "The British Betrayed Us!"
UPI.601.desc:0 "Churchill shook with mighty rage as he heard the response. Britain had...abandoned him? After all this?! After everything he had done, everything he had sacrificed, every good man who died, they were just abandoning him here, in the heart of darkness itself?! No, no, no this would not do, this could not do! \n\n If Britain wasn’t going to help him, if Britain thought India was a lost cause, if they did not want the jewel of the Empire, carved in his image, then they would have nothing! The plans would be drawn up - though the generals protested, he insisted that he could fight the British to a draw at the very least. He knew the land better, and they probably wouldn’t even commit too many men. It was time for him to fight."

Of course, they might not truly understand everything we do, to not understand all the context we have, to not understand what we had to do.

UPI.603.t:0 "Horrors of Churchill"
UPI.603.desc:0 "Churchill cannot hide what he did to India. As the British envoy rolls through the cities, the people look in fear, hide in their rooms, and do not come out. India, so bustling and populous, looks like a ghost town to any observer. Mass plots of recently turned earth, explained as rice fields or some other such thing, emanate a smell so foul, the only proper response is to cover your nose and gag. Churchill received his visitors with great and wonderful fanfare, but there was a coldness in every house, in every room, they dined in, spoke in. His liveliness could not hide it. His explanations could not be believed. The envoy left with a simple message - do not give him the governorship."

UPI.604.t:0 "Churchill's Resignation Demanded"
UPI.604.desc:0 "The resignation of Churchill was demanded in most dramatic fashion by the British. This was...something he wouldn’t accept. Not after all this time, not after all this blood was spilt, not after everything that he sacrificed. He would rally his men, defend his claim like so many emperors and kings of old, and if need be, he would die defending what was his! No Empire across the sea could declare who was and was not legitimate, no King from across the Ocean could dictate his policy! It would be his India, or no one’s India!"
UPI.604.a:0 "Rally the soldiers!"

UPI.605.t:0 "Churchill Declared Secretary of India"
UPI.605.desc:0 "Churchill’s rule has been legitimized by Britain. They...will remain very hands off, of course. No one wants to touch what he’s done, the fragile balance he has struck, and for good reason. No one could secure India like him, no one could make everything work the way he has. There is no reason for British interference, merely British complacency. Most working men didn’t care what happened to Indians, and as far as Churchill was concerned, they didn’t need to care or hear what was going on. So long as he could keep everything stable, so long as he could keep his rule going, the British need not cast their gaze upon him."

UPI.701.desc:0 "The Empire of Churchill, the Raj. India - under his control, under his thumb. After so much sacrifice, after so much toil, after so much work, he knew he had won it all. He ignored the gunshots ringing out from the nearby military base, a near constant timer of minutes through the hour, his eyes glazed over reading military reports, understanding that his position was, at this moment, secure. \n\n His methods wre firm, brutal even, but justified in this wasteland. His methods were effective, few could deny that, and even as he did things that made the impotent diplomats and connections with Europe hem and haw and protest, he knew that everything had been worth it. If it wasn’t, if he had erred, then he would know. But the sunset, blessing him and his own Empire, assured him that he had done everything just in the world. \n\n Perhaps now, watching the sun set over Uttar Pradesh, he could rest, relax. Let the tension in his body fade away. For he had won, and the Indians of future generations, the English of this generation, would learn to speak his name with reverence, awe, and aspiration. He had won. Another series of gunshots marked another five minute interval, and there was only one thought on his mind."

The British Empire has declined over these many years, and this has been apparent to all observers, to all who might seek to understand it. In the corpse of empires, there are maggots, warlords who feast upon the corpse and give back nothing but more chaos and grime and filth. But there are also figures of great repute who stand to hold back the tide. We men of India, we soldiers of the Raj, are such figures. A new Charlemagne, a new Napoleon, a new Bismark, has risen in India, and the sun of the British Empire has set. Ours, however, has just begun rising. God bless India. God bless us all.”"

It shall be beautiful, as a fire burning a home. It shall be deadly, as the hawk diving upon the rabbit. It shall be unrelenting as the sea, as unstoppable as the tide, and it shall ensure that all are swept up in it."
