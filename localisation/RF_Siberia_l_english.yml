sib.1.title:0 "Grishin-Almazov’s Breakdown"
sib.1.desc:0 "Aleksey Gríshin-Almázov is aging. He has gotten back pains over the past few weeks, things have been more stressful and more taxing. He groaned as he saw the amount of paperwork coming for today; but the groan was a mild expression of a much larger issue - Gríshin-Almázov was feeling awful. Everything felt like a farce; he looked around his fancy villa and then thought about the people starving in the countryside - the political divisions facing the country, and how a non-aligned administration can no longer continue. It is clear to him now. He sat up from his chair, his gloved hands slamming on the table as he screams violently, his maid quickly running to him to wonder if he was well. Subsequently, chaos dwindled out of the room as more screaming and swear words were slurred out, and the poor Gríshin-Almázov then sat down... on the floor, and began to whimper and weep. \n\nAfter few hours, Governor General sat down in front of his desk and begun writing in his journal. He came to a realization, that he must create a council of people who have a good idea how to keep this land in one piece. The question is, who would these people be?\n\nPerhaps the answer was in front of his eyes all along, and the only way to bring stability to Siberia is by reinforcing his reign? If he were to fill the Directoriate with Black Hundreds, remove any opponents through violent means, assert the country as Russian and loyal to Petrograd, maybe then, all the problems would be dealt with. If a totalitarian rule keeps things in order, so be it!\n\nOr maybe, that would only worsen things, and Siberia will remain a broken country unless the needs of her people are satisfied? Maybe it's time for a change in course? Aleksey could invite Autonomists into the Directoriate, distance the country from all Tsarist influence and recognize it as Siberian, not Russian. With that and democratization, prosperity might come as well.\n\nAlmázov remembered, that in urban areas there is a rapidly growing movement of so called Solidarists. They came forward with the ideas of a country as an organic unity, of class fellowship in the name of national brotherhood, and reinvention of russian culture. A radical option to be sure, but inviting those people into the Directoriate might be a beginning of something new.\n\nIf one side is chosen, the others will of course be incredibly opposed. Governor General has eventually made his decision:"
sib.1.a:0 "Ally the Autonomists."
sib.1.b:0 "Side with the Black Hundreds."
sib.1.c:0 "Reach out to Solidarists."
sib.2.title:0 "1938 Elections: First Federal Government"
sib.2.desc:0 "As part of the procceedings decided by the Governor-General, Siberia has become a democracy, and so it must create it's first Federal Government, which will decide the future of the Nation from here on out. Conservatives, Social Democrats, and Liberals all battle out in debates, conventions, and all kinds of political machinery, things which Siberians from Novy Port to Novosibirsk did not see until recently. As things heated up and candidates lost favour, only three came out on top; Nikolay Anov from the Social Democratic wing of the Autonomists, Ivan Serebrennikov from the Conservative Wing, and finally Aleksandr Gattenberger from the Liberal wing. Who shall be victorious at the end, of course, is up to the people of Siberia, who will decide through elections as described in our Constitution."
sib.2.a:0 "Nikolay Anov dominates!"
sib.2.b:0 "Aleksandr Gattenberger has his victory!"
sib.2.c:0 "Ivan Serebrennikov wins the rural areas!"
sib.3.title:0 "1942 Elections: Second Federal Government"
sib.3.desc:0 "It has been four years since the last expression of Democracy in this great land. Our nation has improved much since then, and has become even more of a bigger power in the World Stage. Subsequently, as per democratic tradition and as described in our Constitution, elections must happen for a new Federal Government every 4 years; and therefore, either the incumbent will be elected once more, or we will see a new face in power. Regardless, people have experienced their first taste of what democracy really is like, and they quite enjoy it; our Government has approval from across the spectrum as the defining government which will set the stage for decades to come. Regardless, it is voting time! Who shall win these new elections?"
sib.3.a:0 "Nikolay Anov wins!"
sib.3.b:0 "Aleksandr Gattenberger is victorious!"

sib.4.desc:0 "Our Dear Holy Russia has fallen into civil war between Drozdovites and Kolchakists, and Siberia stands in a situation where it cannot choose allegiances so easily. It has been decided by the Governor-General that the best course of action is a declaration of independence, however may it be done constitutionally or by force, as by choice of who he sided with before the Drozdovite War."

sib.5.title:0 "Joining the League of Nations"
sib.5.desc:0 "The first step of every fledging nation in the World is to join the League of Nations, an international organization seeking to foment cooperation between all countries of the World in the name of ensuring peace and a progressive future. Of course, then, we applied to join as a new nation - and were accepted by virtue of our solid democratic values, our robust Constitution, and our inalienable rights to every person in the country. Therefore, we shall begin our first speech in the League of Nations and then embrace the democratic proccesses that come with being a member of said organization."
sib.5.a:0 "A bright future for our cold land."
sib.5.b:0 "Perhaps we should put that aside for now."
sib.6.title:0 "Invitation to the European Union"
sib.6.desc:0 "The Siberian Republic has invited us to join their 'European Union', an European-culturally centered organization based on mutual defense and mutual open borders, alongside free tariffs and many other things in the name of Cultural European Unity in North Asia. Shall we join?"
sib.6.a:0 "Yes please!"
sib.6.b:0 "An Europe without Europe? Ridiculous."
sib.7.title:0 "A Dying Flower"
sib.7.desc:0 "Siberia is a dying flower. Governor-General may not want to admit it, but it hasn't been watered in long. It hasn't felt the touch of cold springs against it's vast dirt, and now it is dying; as much as reaction and counterreform have attempted to secure Siberia in the name of Holy Russia, more and more elements, from the countryside to the urban areas attack our local officers and think of what could have been if the other factions had the power, instead. Writers and intellectuals look outside to see policemen shooting innocent people, and slowly but surely more discontent appears around every corner. Illusions of autonomy, Illusions of economic prosperity and illusions of appeal to tradition have lost their appeal in the eyes of the many peoples of Siberia. But no, this does not matter. None of this matters. Governor-General came to Novosibirsk after leaving his dacha and went to a podium, placing down a microphone and preparing speakers, waiting for the crowd to show up. As they huddled around in the cold, the Governor-General began to proclaim: \n \"Subjects of Holy Russia! We have now been given, by the pure and guiding, gentle hand of Petrograd, extensive autonomies which I will list now.\" \n It didn't matter, of course. He was immediately interrupted by an angry mob. This mob, distracting him, did not notice the gunman in their midst who subsequently began to shoot at the Governor-General. Of course, the gunman was immediately annihilated and made into mist, but Almazov was grazed in the shoulder by a bullet, and so he was huddled back to his car. Subsequently, several areas across Siberia, hearing that the Governor-General was shot, immediately declared independence as the Siberian People's Republic and subsequently several smaller soviets were integrated into the larger People's Republic. With Novosibirsk under siege, it seems that the truth finally came out."
sib.7.a:0 "Siberia needed to wet herself with blood."
