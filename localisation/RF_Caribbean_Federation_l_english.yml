cyn.1.title:0 "Constitutional Convention"
cyn.1.desc:0 "Today, delegates from all over the Caribbean Federation have gathered to organize the Constitutional Convention, which was said would occur after a 2-year period of provisional government. With a massive amount of white refugees coming to the Caribbean seeking for a warm, welcoming France, we have been forced to deal with a number of people that we can barely support, and now it will be decided if elections should occur or if we should maintain the provisional Government until the Emergency is over."
cyn.1.a:0 "Maintain the Provisional Government, and maintain colonial authority. We are not ready for democracy."
cyn.1.b:0 "Begin elections immediately; We must not become tyrants!"
cyn.2.title:0 "1936 Elections"
cyn.2.desc:0 "After hastily put-together ballots have been created across the country, and campaigns from all over the place have been done, one victor has come out on top, and that is..."
cyn.2.a:0 "André Tardieu and the Parti Libéral has won the election with the help of the white emigrés!"
cyn.2.b:0 "The Parti Socialiste and Legitimus takes the seat of power for the common people!"
cyn.3.title:0 "André Alike boycotts the Provisional Government"
cyn.3.desc:0 "André Alike and his band of Councilists have begun rallying against our regime, claiming we are "nothing but the children of imperialists"! He has been organizing strikes all over Cayenne, and has been causing trouble for the white emigrés, too."
cyn.3.a:0 "Crack down hard on this Councilist once and for all!"
cyn.4.title:0 "The Victory of the People"
cyn.4.desc:0 "André Aliker and his band of revolutionaries, after weeks in hiding, have managed to assault local military positions in Cayenne despite our attempts to crack down on leftist forces. After an extremely intense battle at the Montjoly, the revolutionaries have seized the local government buildings and proclaimed the Caribbean Popular Republic. Local liberals and those loyal to our Government have been arrested, and now all that is left is the fires of revolutionary passion."
cyn.4.a:0 "This land is your land."
