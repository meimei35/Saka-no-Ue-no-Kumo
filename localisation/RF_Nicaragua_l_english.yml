#LEADER DESCRITIONS#
POLITICS_MOSELEY_DESC:0 "George Van Horny Moseley has become the emergency administer of Nicaragua since the beginning of the occupation of the country, by the US. He has commited to being neutral in administration, but has often favoured big business like the UFC to ensure Pro-American elements within Nicaragua. He seeks to abolish socialism entirely from Nicaragua and create a Republic, not a Democracy."

#IDEAS#
NIC_renegade_adminstration:0 "The Renegade Administration"
NIC_renegade_adminstration_desc:0 "Occupied Nicaragua has become a symbol of American domination in the New World and has resulted in immense resentment around the countryside and in general around Central America. Many of the lower class saw no problem with the former socialist regime in Nicaragua, and so our administration can barely hold onto the bigger landmarks and cities."
