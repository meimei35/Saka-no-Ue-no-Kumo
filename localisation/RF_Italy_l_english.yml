ITALIAN_EMPIRE_DESC:0 "The Kingdom of Italy is probably the greatest victor of the Great War, but its gains have carried heavy costs. The empire is vastly overextended, the economy is grinding to a halt, and for 20 years the military has stagnated. Despite this, the strength of the ruling United Democratic Party of Italy has made it the sole bastion of European liberalism. How long can it last?"

ITA_italian_constitution:0 "Constitution of the Kingdom of Italy"
ITA_italian_constitution_desc:0 "Seeing the political success of the United Kingdom after the end of the Velikaya Voyna, PM Vittorio Emmanuele Orlando suggested changing the Statuto Albertino to mimic the UK laws, always adapting them to Italy, of course. The new constitution enjoys great acceptance among the population and it has been transformed into unity symbol for Italy."

The new constitution enjoys great acceptance among the population and it has been transformed into unity symbol for Italy."
ITA_great_war_itch:0 "Great War Itch"
ITA_great_war_itch_desc:0 "Even though Italy emerged victorious in the Velikaya Voyna, it had a great cost. Almost 2 million Italians, both civilians and military, lost their lives in the conflict. The general public opinion towards war drastically changed after the conflict. Now it's very common for huge numbers of young men to avoid, one way or another, military service and many generals are resistant to go back to the trenches to fight."
ITA_london_market_crash:0 "London Market Crash"
ITA_great_war_itch_desc:0 "In 1934, the London Stock Market crashed."
ITA_mediterranean_standoff:0 "Mediterranean Standoff"
ITA_mediterranean_standoff_desc:0 "Since the end of the Velikaya Voyna, all the Mediterranean nations have been fighting a blodless war. Known as the Mediterranean Standoff, this geopolitical situation has several causes; among them the Italian desire to be the most influetial nation in the Mediterranean, the British attempt to still exert it's influence there (although Egypt and Syria have achieved quite a grade of autonomy and only Gibraltar, Malta and Cyprus remain firmly in British hands) and the creation of republican regimes in Spain and Greece (although Greece still has a king, but PM Eleftherios Venizelos and his party have all the power). Every Mediterranean nation wants different things which often clash with the interests of the other neighbors. This situation has also brached outside the Mediterranean, specially into the Balkans."

italy.1.t:0 "A Crisis of Conscience"
italy.1.d:0 "Ivanoe Bonomi, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Italy and informal leader of the left wing of the United Democratic Party, gazed out at the crowds milling through the Piazza del Popolo. He took a long sip of his espresso and quickly flicked his eyes over the newspaper in front of him. Lots of political editorials this week, mainly concerning the upcoming handover of power to Sturzo and the right wing of the party. As he read, he felt himself growing increasingly agitated, but without any clear reason. What was wrong with him today?\n\nHe began to understand as he walked back to the Palazzo Chigi. It was that word, the one word that had brought so many Italians to accept and even endorse almost 15 years of PUDI rule.\n\n“Democratic”.\n\nSince the beginning, the trust he had shared with Giolitti and Sturzo had hinged upon that word. It was the word that had brought so many millions of Italians to the voting booths to vote for their new party. It was the word that had also fueled the meteoric rise of the Partito Radicale, split the Partito Socialista irrevocably, and strangled the Partito Popolare in the cradle. Now this word, this idea, began to itch and eventually to tear at the conscience of the man to whom it was so dear.\n\nWas this really what he had hoped for? The PUDI was created as a united front against extremist aggression, but it had accumulated so many of the worst flaws of a liberal party. Corruption, cronyism, cynical manipulation-- this was becoming the PUDI’s bread and butter. Worst of all though, by taking up the mantle of Italian democracy in the widest way possible. It had become a party of political monopoly, the only safe choice for the Italian people in a world turning away from freedom.\n\nSettling into a chair at his office, he removed his private diary from a locked drawer.  After much soul-searching, he took up his favorite pen and wrote the following:"
italy.1.a:0 "Whatever happens, we must all make sacrifices for the safety of Italian democracy."
italy.1.b:0 "As far as democracy goes, we must not surrender that which is most important."

While it is no surprise the economic depression is continuing, the amount of damage it has caused was less well-anticipated. Deflation from the collapse of both small banks and Credito Italiano combined with our over-reliance on imports from Austria and the Balkans in the face of our struggling industrial sector has caused prices to fall by 8%. Furthermore, private imports of capital goods increasing our farming production combined with the fall in demand has resulted in farmers overproducing their goods causing an increase in poverty amongst out farmers. The report concludes that over the past year unemployment has increased by about 10% and GDP has not risen at all and if anything has fallen by more than a percent. The government is in shock and has no idea of how to respond to this news while the media has wasted little time in reporting it causing outrage from our citizens for this show of government incompetence."

italy.22.a:0 "Even the pope loves Balbo."

italy.23.t:0 "The Great Conference - Beginning Phase"
italy.23.d:0 "Pietro Badogilo was in his office when he received orders from Ill Duce. An hour later, he was driven to the designated location by his chauffeur. In 45 minutes, the Marshal was finally able to see it.\nIt was an extensive complex, covering perhaps a couple of acres counting both the building itself and the outdoor plaza and recreation area. The building itself was rather simple and plain, built by architects that favored sustainability and efficiency rather than beauty. As soon as his chauffeur stopped the car in front of the plaza and he walked out of the car and into the plaza, Badogilo was greeted by the staff of this building, who then ushered him into the structure. The staff gave him a brief tour of the building, designating him where everything was at: the kitchen, washrooms and bathing centers, the sleeping quarters, everything to ensure that one could live in relative comfort here.\nOnce the tour ended, the staff finally guided him to one final room: a large room with a panel roof. In the room were numerous desks and tables, most covered in large boxes containing a forest’s worth of paper and files, others were covered in maps of various areas of the world and had small figures dotted on them. The only clear table was in the center, one that would be used for meetings.\nAround said table stood the finest military minds Italy could offer, Badoglio included. They were all here due to a single order by Ill Duce Balbo: To devise new and infallible warplans that are to be used in Italy’s future wars of conquest and bring glory to the peninsula and the government that rules it.\nThere was a pregnant silence in the air for a few moments, then Marshal De Bono spoke up."
italy.23.a:0 "\"Well, now that we’re all here, let’s get to work. We don’t want to keep Ill Duce waiting, do we?\""

italy.24.t:0 "The Great Conference- Second Phase"
italy.24.d:0 "A few months have passed, but to the High Command, it feels like years.\nLong have they removed their stuffy military uniforms in favor of wearing much more breathable short-sleeve shirts, but it did little to deal with the heat. They have tore the papers from their boxes and poured over them as their sweat dripped and stained the papers. Ashtrays and half-drunk bottles of alcohol were scattered across the room and a rancid combination of sweat, cigarette ash, coffee grounds,and stale liquor have long since created a foul odor that has spread across the complex. Marshals Messe and Graziani would get into an argument about the ideal formation for a particular combat situation, but both were too tired to go to any length beyond that and the argument ended with both of them opening new bottles of scotch. Each one of them were beginning to develop bags under their eyes they spent one too-many restless nights subsumed in their work.\nFor once in the lives of each member of the High Command, they were all beginning to regret their choice in career."
italy.24.a:0 "God, please save us from this Hell!"

italy.25.t:0 "The Great Conference- Final Phase"
italy.25.d:0 "Italo Balbo, Ill Duce and the undisputed ruler of Italy, was currently going through the newest speech his writers typed up for a up-coming public appearance when someone suddenly barged into his office uninvited and unexpected.\nThe man in question looked to be in his 60s, reaching his 70s. He wore a decorated military uniform, showing him to be a respected and influential member of Italy’s armed forces, but Balbo had difficulty recognizing him at first. Dark circles had developed under his eyes and his complexion was paler from many days staying entirely inside. He gave Balbo a tired smile and began to speak.\n\"Apologies that I couldn’t contact you earlier, Ill Duce,\" Marshal Badogilo said, \"our phone lines were damaged. What I am here for, on behalf of the rest of the High Command, is to say ...Italy is now ready for any conflict that should come to it!\""

italy.39.d:0 "Ever since the unification of the nation, one great question has haunted the consciousness of the King’s ministers-- the relationship of Italy with the British Empire. For well over a century, the Mediterranean has been a British lake. This is obviously intolerable to the Duce’s plans for European (and therefore global) dominance. However, this is predicated on the assumption that the British will be actively hostile in our pursuit of supremacy over the futurist dog-fuckers and the dirty Gothic commies. This may not happen, but we must play our hand carefully. At the end of the day, this all rests on the Duce’s decision. Sir-- how should we deal with the Anglo?"

ITA_magical_societies:0 "Occult Societies"
ITA_magical_societies_desc:0 "Despite as predicted it having lower acceptance among the masses our newly established ruling class has come to embrace Evola's religious beliefs far more comfortably than the alternatives offered by Catholicism and atheism.

ITA_constrained_science:0 "Science Constrained"
ITA_constrained_science_desc:0 "It is no surprise that the vacuous modernist values sciences study of the material world over spiritual exploration.
