#LEADER DESCRITIONS#
POLITICS_Schleicher_DESC:0 "A true-born son of Prussia, von Schleicher was raised in the unified German Empire, growing to serve in its mighty armies as a young man. Schleicher gained some renown during the Great War, serving as the trusted assistant to Wilhelm Groener in the latter years of the conflict. It was von Schleicher who assisted in the formation of the Freikorps in the wake of the Kaiser's abdication and growing tension between the Ebert government and the revolutionary elements in German politics. When the Spartakus League finally struck in 1919, von Schleicher was ready with the Freikorps to assist the war-hero Paul von Hindenburg in saving the foolish Ebert from his own disaster. Yet it was not to be, the faithful soldiers of Old Germany were defeated and broken by the Reds, who pursued them into the seas. Arriving in Prussia, von Schleicher and Hindenburg sought to reorganise the surviving elements of the German Empire, only to find many former Officers had fled to Austria, taking solace in the mountains of their former ally. After serving under Hindenburg for over a decade, crushing the agents of the Communists and ensuring petty squabbles did not split the Freikorps, von Schleicher would succeed the old marshal in 1934, inheriting a government of loyal and dedicated associates. Though Prussia is small, Reichsmarschall von Schleicher is no brute and knows that Prussia's strength lies in its legacy and its legitimacy. With enough scheming, the Red Giant can be brought down, and the Freikorps, Reichswehr and von Schleicher himself shall revive that grand Germany that nearly claimed the world."

The Junkers resided in Prussia before even the unification of Germany and remain today as the proprietors of the majority of the arable land in Prussia.

PRS_disloyal_proletariat_desc:0 "The accursed revolution was popular in most German cities, including both Danzig and Königsberg, where the Ostseeflotte was stationed. During the revolution, solidarity strikes and demonstartions in support of the sailors' comrades in Bremen, Hamburg and other cities crippled the local garrisons from supporting the western reaches of the Empire. While the revolution is Prussia was strangled, the workers never truly gave up their dreams of socialism. Thankfully, the Freikorps and Sicherheitspolizei crush their strikes and eliminate Red agents in our lands, keeping them from organising and prevent their aspiriations from becoming a threat."

The army was thus shaken and only the heroic actions of the proud patriots of the Freikorps prevented the total collapse of the legitimate government in Prussia. With the fall of Berlin and the western reaches, most Freikorps who could escape arrived in Prussia, creating our little bastion of trueblooded Germans. With their numbers supplementing the ranks of the Reichswehr, the brave sons of Prussia and Germany stand poised to avenge 1919 and slay this Red Menace once and for all."

For months the administration had expected the grain shortages: the naval imports were insufficient to supply the entire nation and trade with Poland was slow due to conflicting opinions within the Junta on our future with Poland. Coupled with a poor harvest and the Freikorps seizing stashed grain from supposed \"Reds\", it is no surprise the hungry workers and peasants began marching in the streets. Reichsmarschall von Schleicher's command was simple, surpress the crowds by any means necessary. However, his order was tempered by the other members of the Junta. The Freikorps liason, officially \"Minister of Anti-Communist Security\", Waldemar Pabst suggested deploying Freikorps groups to disperse the mobs and target the leaders. An opposing view was presented by General von der Schulenburg, who suggested we open a dialogue with the protestors and arrest only the most violent with military police.

prussia.69.desc:0 "Reichsmarschall von Schulenburg has met today with representatives of both the sole legal trade union, that is the Christian Workers' Union, and the many illegal unions who have been under observation. In the past, such illegal Trade Unions would be allowed to fester, as state agents infiltrated and gathered information on the most radical members, until they were deemed sufficiently large and were shut down with every member arrested. However, it seems the Reichsmarschall has decided a new approach.\n\nMeeting with the Union representatives allowed the Reichsmarschall to convey his blessing for their open organisation, providing that the Trade Unions agree to not strike, sabotage production during wartime or distribute illegal material. All representatives of course agreed to the proposals, the Christian Workers' Union even suggested a state-mandated management course for prospective union leaders, which would teach proper Prussian values, such as diligence, anti-Communism and piety. The Reichsmarschall agreed to take such a proposal into consideration, but did inform the representatives that there would be inspections of the Unions' activities by state operatives. The state operatives were almost entirely made up of enthusiatic, young emigres from the Homeland, the Reichsmarschall had informed the representatives, though each had been arduously vetted to ensure they were free from ideological corruption. The operatives would simply advise and guide the newly sanctioned unions, ensuring they could begin organising as soon as possible, and organise workers as best they could. The Christian Workers' Union, was of course exempt from such visits. The Reichsmarschall smiled as he assured their leader that their organisation was already fulfilling their role in Prussian society and would become an invaluable boon to the von Schulenburg's new Regime."

prussia.70.t:0 "The foundation of the Volkskorps"
prussia.70.desc:0 "With the disbanding of the Freikorps, it has become clear to the Prussian General Staff that an offensive maneuvere out of the country would leave the Homefront open to incursion by our Red kin to the West. Prussia simply does not have the liberty to train a standing army just to defend our cities, indeed, the Freikorps were essential to the considerations of the General Staff.\n\nThe Reichsmarschall fortunately had already considered an alternative. A new volunteer militia, in a similar vein to the Freikorps, but without the harmful reputation they had attained in the years following the Civil War. Reichsmarschall von Schulenburg suggested naming them the Volkskorps and deftly proposed using loyal commanders from the Army to train these new volunteers, while filling in the commanders' spaces in the Army with capable Freikorps veterans.\n\nMost of the General Staff were uncertain. The Freikorps had clearly felt betrayed by their disbanding and outlawing, any veteran of their organisation would never serve the Prussian state now. The Reichsmarschall dismissed such fears, stating that arrangements had already been made. In fact, the Volkskorps were already being formed, with von Schulenburg's personally selected officers training these new militias. The Reichsmarschall closed the session pronouncing that the last stage of the preparation for the Reclaimaition had begun and that soon Prussian boots would walk on German soil once more. Many of the General Staff would meet later in dark rooms, unknown to the Reichsmarschall, and talking of their apprehension as to von Schulenburg's ineffective governance and allowance of non-military citizens to begin playing a role in Prussian society again."
