#LEADER DESCRITIONS#
POLITICS_PADMORE_DESC:0 "§YBorn 28th June 1903, Arouca, Trinidad § \n\n Born Malcom Ivan Meredith Nurse, Padmore was surrounded by opression from an early life. His Great-grandparent was sold into slavery to work to his death in Barbados from Africa, being part of the Asante tribe as a warrior that fought the British in several colonial wars. After many decades of his family line being in slavery, eventually they were freed by the British authorities, who had recently outlawed slavery. His father had been a local schoolmaster and married Anna Susanna Symister of Antigua, a scholar in naturalism. Padmore, as he was known in his writings in favor of communism that permeated the African-American political scene for years, went to the USA in 1924 to take up medical studies and campaign for Leninism and the Bolshevik tradition that was being destroyed by the pro-Kolchak forces. After the London Stock Market Crash, he realized that his future was in Liberia, where he could rouse the masses and throw out Garvey's supporters which rallied for an ultra-nationalist dictatorship in Liberia. Eventually, he made an alliance with the Poro chiefs of the countryside of Liberia after a 1935 expedition to the Hinterlands, and was plotting to take over Monrovia for over a year. Now that he is in power, he is fully able to exercise his utopian ideals of a purely African society, cleansed of American elements, and with extensive socialist backing in a Poro-Communist alliance."
POLITICS_GARVEY_DESC:0 "§YBorn 17th August 1887, Saint Ann's Bay, Jamaica § \n\n There is little that can be said about Marcus Garvey that isn't said by his enormously vibrant actions, rallies, and speeches - his violent clamors and rallies full of vitality, and his militarism that rallies over a hundred thousand African-Americans to this day. Garvey was born to a prosperous family in Jamaica, and worked as a teenager. In Kingston, he got involved with trade unionism and became interested in the ideas permeating the society which surrounded him, and eventually developed a Pan-Africanist society in Jamaica named the UNIA. Two years later, he moved to the United States and began rallying the local African-American population of the South with a fierce vitality which was unprecedented by many Americans, eventually making deals with the Ku Klux Klan in securing trade routes to bring African-Americans back to their homeland - Africa. Despite small cells of support at the start, Garvey preservered, and with over two decades of build-up, he's managed to rally hundreds of thousands of African-Americans to leave America for a future in Liberia, a society that he sees as the clay to create an utopian nation which is militaristic, totalitarian in it's militancy, and powerful enough to combat Western imperialists, while still maintaining many American values over to the new nation. Now that Garvey managed to coup the Government, he's reached the absolute peak of his power - ruling a nation."
POLITICS_FIRESTONE_DESC:0 "§YBorn 20th April 1898, Columbiana, Ohio, USA § \n\n Little doubt remains that Harvey Firestone Jr. Was a privileged child. He studied in a private university, and he is the child of Harvey Samuel Firestone, one of the most powerful people in all of the rubber industry of the United States. Therefore, he's always been an ambitious child, seeking at all costs to be just like his father in success - and surely enough, he has succeeded with one of the most daring plots of the 20th century; take over an entire nation and turn it into a giant rubber-producing corporation. Now that he has total control over Liberia after the chaos with the dissolution of the True Whig Party, Harvey Firestone Jr. Has an immense road up towards him, which will either bring Liberia to a new age or make it fall to another profoundly corrupt oligarchy."

Groups of mostly young men, immigrants from US started to organise loose associations quite a while ago but recently those merged into singular grassroots movement lead by ever controversial Marcus Garvey. Their dissatisfaction with their new homeland beared a fruit in a form of organised march towards the capital. While organisers denny any violent intentions, armed crowds are likened more to marching army than peacefull demonstration. Goverment response can be only one: meet protestors in open field.\n\n Two groups meet outside the city limits..."

It's unclear how Garvey was able to secure so much sympathy in the military but facts are undeniable: uninterupted he marched into the capital in triumph like a Black Ceasar. Given emergency powers, in a radio speech he assured citizens of Liberia that their future is secure and there are no reasons to worry. Liberia is on a path towards greater tomorrow! \n\n People at large took government takeover surprisingly well. Tension was growing for quite a while, everyone was expecting something to happen. Something indeed happening seemingly put an end to that. Now, everyone could just go back to their daily lifes... Except not. Ease with which garveists convinced military to join them should be suspicious but in their triumph they were blinded to this fact. Army was indeed infiltrated by their supporters, sure. But not just by them. For years society way more ancient and secretive than pan-africanists had spread its webs over Liberia. And current troubles were perfect time for the spider to strike. \n Poro societies came to revolt. Within army, within goverment, within homes of everyday citizens raised vicious horde ready to take away back their premordial birthright..."

We will secure stability and prosperity of this land and its people. Is this a crime if we secure a living wage for ourselves while doing so?' \n\n Harvey Firestone Jr. wasn't much of speaker. Short adress to the troops was just a formality. What they respected was hard cash. They were finest american and russian mercenaries money could buy. He on the other hand respected actions. Swift, well planned, succesfull. Negroes were fighting over nonsensical pie in the sky. He had a simple vission: Firestone Company Grounds, prosperous and rich. \n In well planned action mercenaries were to crush tired in fight Poro and secure stability. The rubber production can't be hindered by this farce. Now, the fate lies in the balance as the two sides come to a head..."

Eventually, after extreme violence in the capital, it appears that they have come out on top, decapitating one of the Poro chiefs and cutting the hands off of the children of the Poro-associated families, brutally seizing the Government capital as George Padmore was brutally hacked to death. It appears that Liberia, after days of anarchy, has finally fallen to total corporate control."

We need to deal with this in the root, immediately. Most of our Ministry demands we invade Liberia as we are a much larger and much better-equipped nation, even with the lack of the British here. Surely we will win against them."

lib.50.desc:0 "We, as the people of Liberia, have suffered through a lot these past few years and managed to survive through it all as a shining example of democracy and a beacon of liberty. We did not allow extremism to ferment in our land, and we kicked out the ones who tried to destroy our beautiful nation. It is high time that we celebrate, creating a big public party in Monrovia where everyone is invited, a toast to liberty - a toast to our freedom as the freest nation in Africa. \n\n We are now ready to look outwards into a future of trade and prosperity, and potentially even wealth where we can rival even some Central American countries in terms of purchasing power. It has come to the realization of us all that we have reached it, everyone, from the youngest to the oldest, from the most educated to the simplest peasant, understands this simple truth now and forever;"

lib.99.desc:0 "The Muzungu has been feeling a great terror since we have come to power. We have since attacked every White investor coming into Liberia, destroying local Firestone rubber farms, and have ensured at all costs that the White Man flees Liberia forever. However, this is not the only problem we face; there is also the newest muzungu, the newest white man, the Americo-Liberian. He is the one that is assimilated into American culture, speaks American, talks American, thinks American, and believes in American ideals. He must be done away with immediately and violently in a people's war in the Interior, where we shall do away with all elements of the former Americo-Liberian aristocracy which had forever shackled the native peoples of Liberia in opression and slavery. No longer, as we will wipe out a quarter of Monrovia if nescessary to ensure that Liberia can be truly free as it's native land, not as an American colony, regardless of the color of the devil that comes colonize our lands."

lib.40.desc:0 "We've had enough of this populist madman destroying our infrastructure and demanding that we surrender immediately to his forces, which barely even exist. It is high time we begin the hunt for him - And it shall begin by looking at the port of Harper, and then forward into the Hinterlands, beyond our Grain Coast, as the slave-owners used to call it. We shall ensure at all costs that the blood of our brothers is avenged, and that Garvey feels their pain times one hundred."

lib.90.desc:0 "It has been over two years since Marcus Garvey did the Ten Thousand Men March and seized Monrovia for himself, creating the state of New Africa and ensuring that the future of Africa lies in the hands of the African people coming back from opression by colonialists. It is clear, then, that Liberia has saved itself from oligarchic hell and all forms of Nativism which sought to destroy the Liberian identity. And it is then, with Garvey standing just as vigorous as always, looking around his surroundings and proclaiming, whilst wearing his regal clothes, appearing like the Ceasar of Africa, he stood and loudly proclaimed:"

lib.5.desc:0 "A strange development has taken place lately. A group calling themselves "Pride of Liberia" has developed among local populace. Recruiting mainly from immigrants from USA and educated, urban populace of the country "Pride" seems to be take inspiration from grups like masons and the Klan to serve as a counterpart to tribal Poro societies. It is also engaging in sometimes violent clashes with the tribal population. While many see development what is mockingly called "black klan" as a threat to countries stability, others point that such society is quite usefull in fight against tribal secret societies and sects if properly utilised."

Large, collaborative artistic effort of not just multiple artists but whole artistic cliques was on the crosshairs of cultural elites for quite a while as an object of both of interest and ridicule. Some critics called it too grand to be possible to finish, a monumental waste of money, racial self-idolatry on a cosmic scale... But against all odds movie was finally finished.  Monumental, almost three hours long masterpiece was at last screened to wider audience in Monrovia. Premiere night was attended by creme of the crop of Liberia social circles and whole crowd of personnel involved with the production involving George Wells Parker, Herman Poole Blount and many others. Way bigger crowd gathered outside of the cinema in hopes of catching a glimpse of the so long awaited curiosity. \n Initial reviews are mixed: some praised richness of themes and almost dream-like atmosphere, others criticised hard to follow plot. Whatever anyone says, everyone wants to see it. First major motion picture of Liberia is sure to be a smash hit!"

Everyone from the fringe Rastafarians, who believe Haile Selassie was an avatar of the Christian God, with a small militia led by Leonard Percival Howell along with being under a council of several priests - the Pharaonists who believe in creating a new Kemet in Liberia and later in Africa altogether, including Egypt, led by Dusé Mohammed Ali and Herman Poole Blount (who split from the normal Pharaonists to create a mystical musical group called Sun Ra's Arkestra which believes that he, along with the ancient Egypytians, has had contact with extraterrestrial beings) and finally the Black Israelite Hebrews, led by Wentworth Arthur Matthew, who believe that the black race is a lost tribe of Israel. Many elements have now come to a head in Monrovia fighting over who is the superior group, and eventually, after extensive fighting with eachother which almost resulted in a violent civil war, Garvey's militias have entered Monrovia and stopped the fighting, demanding the groups have a ceasefire to continue the peace in Liberia. After the fighting ceased, our Leader Marcus Garvey has made a fiery speech demanding unity and fighting sectarianism to ensure that the Black race isn't colonized ever again."

However, he denounced our secularism, demanding we make Islam, the religion he considers 'The Black Religion', to become the State Religion. Of course, we will not follow his demands, but his voice has resonated with many Americo-Liberians which see Islam as the light that will shine Liberia to the future."

lib.9.desc:0 "After a couple of years of development, a wing in the UNIA has created... strange beliefs, to say the least. The Kemetist wing of the UNIA, led by Dusé Mohammad Ali and co-ran by his protegé, Hermann Poole Blount, also known as Le Sony'r Ra, have created an ideal of the Black Race as the true heirs of the Kemetic world, seeing Egypt as the true source of Black identity. However, an even more extreme wing within the wing is the Sun Ra Arkestra, a band of improvisational musicians who believe in creating 'Cosmic Music', a highly experimental form of Jazz. They believe that the ancient Egyptians, and their leader, Hermann Poole Blount, have had contact with extraterrestrial beings from Jupiter (and many other planets) and believe that they sent a message to Blount asking him to create music that would bring his spirit to the stars. The rest of the Kemetic Wing strongly follows Kemetic religious tradition and can speak some form of greeting in ancient Egyptian."

They claim that King Solomon and the Queen Of Sheba are both Israelites and that Ethiopia in general is a holy Israelite territory. They have become increasingly popular as groups uninterested in Islam or Kemetic beliefs have went to them looking for a new perspective on Black Identity, and many synagogues have been formed around Liberia - even if without government funding, they aren't the most sophisticated, but they clearly show profound dedication to their ideals and truly believe that they are the Chosen People."

lib.11.desc:0 "Due to the death of Haile Selassie, it was believed that the fringe religion of Rastafarianism was dissolved due to the lack of a prophet and much religious history, however this is not the case. Most of the World's Rastafarians have moved to Liberia, resulting in Liberia being the most Rastafarian nation in the world (although Liberia has recently exploded in religious diversity), and the 'Remnant' of Rastafarians such as Leonard Percival Howell have gone through great lengths to promote their religion and grow plants of cannabis around Liberia for their sacred rituals. Many of the other groups despise the Rastafarians, however this is not surprising as all of them dislike one another quite strongly. Despite this, Liberia has managed to keep profound social harmony and respect in differences."
