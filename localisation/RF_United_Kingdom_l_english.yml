#BOOKMARKS#
UNITED_KINGDOM_DESC:0 "Victorious in the Great War, the United Kingdom paid the price of this victory through the slaughter of thousands of young men. Bloodied the UK prevailed and the 1920’s saw Britain prosper as the world's sole superpower, its domain unthreatened by hostile states. The 1931 General strike and assassination of the Prime Minister brought this all crashing down, culminating in the 1934 economic crash and ensuing "Great depression". The Kingdom is weak and too many the sun is setting where the empire is one of its main weaknesses. While elections have been called for March, many wonder if a new government will be enough to save the country."

#LEADER DESCRITIONS#
politics_edward_viii_desc:0 "Edward VIII, King of the United Kingdom and the Dominions of the British Empire. Having come to the throne following his father George V death in november 1927 following a battle with septicemia. Under his rule Britain reached its zenith of power and then its decline from the assassination of Prime Minister Arthur Henderson, the London stock market crash and collapse of the British Raj. Edward has acted as a hindrance to the British government due to his various womanizing scandals and political sympathies for radical movements. While the government had hoped his marriage to his ex mistress Thelma Furness may have reigned him in, Edward has just continued with his old ways. Edwards reign is dependent on how much the government is willing to take from Edward and how far he pushes them."

ENG_economic_catastrophe:0 "Economic Catastrophe"
ENG_economic_catastrophe_desc:0 "With the general strike of 1931 and the following London Stock Market Crash, the economy is in a state of utter devastation. Unemployment has skyrocketed, poverty and inflation are also rising at remarkably fast rates. Ineffective government interventions have left the economy at a standstill and further changes must be brought in to repair the economic damage."
ENG_divided_nation:0 "Divided Nation"
ENG_divided_nation_desc:0 "Due to the instability of the country, populist left and right movements have been rising in support, while their paramilitary groups such as the Green Shirts of Kibbo Kift have been battling it out on the streets. As these movements continue to grow in popularity it threatens the very stability of this nation, this needs to end now."
ENG_imperial_eclipse:0 "Imperial Eclipse"
ENG_imperial_eclipse_desc:0 "Due to our economic and political crisis the Empire is overstretched and its structure has turned rotten, collapsing from under us as seen in the fate of the British Raj. The empire is in need of desperate reform to reverse the current decline that grips the empire, otherwise instability will plague the Empire and Britain risks losing more regions to revolts and revolution."
ENG_shadow_of_the_somme:0 "Shadow of the Somme"
ENG_shadow_of_the_somme_desc:0 "While victorious in the Great war, the destruction left was colossal. The major battles especially the Somme, have left a deep wound on our nation.

#DECISIONS (1.5 Update)#
#FOCUSES#
ENG_Royal_Rearmament_Program:0 "Royal Rearmament Program"
ENG_Royal_Rearmament_Program_desc:0 "With the growing instability in the world, the only hope for Britain and her empire to defend itself is too rearm its military. We cannot be sitting ducks waiting for the crocodiles of France, Germany and Russia to devour us. We must begin rearmament, no matter how unpopular it may initially be to the British People."
ENG_BEF:0 "Upgrade the British Expeditionary Force"
ENG_BEF_desc:0 "Should we go to war once more, it will likely be on the fields of Mainland Europe once more. As much as our public may not have the thirst for war, being complacent and letting Europe fall into war once more will only work so long, and we may once more be forced to defend ourselves."
ENG_Walkie_Talkie:0 "Experiment With Walkie Talkies"
ENG_Walkie_Talkie_desc:0 "Walkie-talkies are an interesting tool, man-portable radios that can communicate over many long distances. It is extremely valuable to us, allow faster battlefield communication than ever before. Mere decades ago, we relied on telegraph wires and messangers with notes. Now we can communicate must faster.""
ENG_Intergrate_Bren:0 "Intergrate the Bren Light Machine Gun"
ENG_Intergrate_Bren_desc:0 "The newly developed Bren Light Machine Gun is an effective weapon. Integrating this within British and Commonwealth armed forces will help in the modernization and rearmament of our forces. Making them become a more effective fighting force to take on our enemies across the world."
ENG_radio_tower_calais:0 "Construct Radar in Calais"
ENG_radio_tower_calais_desc:0 "Calais, our sole Mainland holding, is an excellent place to monitor France and Germany in covert ways, getting alerts to any large-scale movements they may make days before they make them. Now, we shall approve the construction of a radar station."
ENG_Motorisation_efforts:0 "Motorisation Efforts"
ENG_Motorisation_efforts_desc:0 "Ground troops, other than being susecptible to trenchfoot and quite miserable when left out in the rain, are also exceptionally slow. However, if we put some squads in trucks, we get a much greater level of mobility. Speeding across the plains, preventing any soldier from setting up barbed-wire defenses against them."
ENG_learn_somme:0 "Learn from the Somme"
ENG_learn_somme_desc:0 "The Somme. We did so much wrong during the Somme. So many dead, so many pointless dead. It is the greatest military disaster we faced our boys with, and it's only proper we understand how to prevent another."
ENG_fullers_plan:0 "Fullers Plan"
ENG_fullers_plan_desc:0 "Fuller's plan involves the heavy use of tanks and mechanized infantry, in order to promote fast, heavy-hitting attacks on a front, shattering enemy defenses and driving circles around them."
ENG_hart_plan:0 "Harts Plan"
ENG_hart_plan_desc:0 "Hart believes that the best plan is to have plans to plan better. Radios, communication between all levels, coordination between our armies and those of our imperial subjects, the British Empire shall be bathed in the constant flame of radio signal on the battlefield."
ENG_brooke_plan:0 "Brookes Plan"
ENG_brooke_plan_desc:0 "What killed so many men in the Great War? A lack of experience, that's what. Conscripts thrown into meatgrinders, made into ground beef by maxims and pounded into the ground by artillery. No idea of how to fight, how to take cover. They knew how to walk, and they learned how to die. No longer."
ENG_marine_core:0 "Fund the Marine Corps"
ENG_marine_core_desc:0 "The Marine Corps is going to be a vital part of our naval plans. Able to respond quickly across the channel, across the ocean if need be, they should be expanded and made even better.
ENG_landing_craft:0 "Upgrade Landing Craft"
ENG_landing_craft_desc:0 "We can't very well toss our men into the sea and hope they swim to their destination! Let's design new landing craft, make sure that our soldiers make it to the beach safely above all else."
ENG_experiment_tank:0 "Tank Experiments"
ENG_experiment_tank_desc:0 "Tanks in the Great War were...limited. Of course, the Mark V is a venerable tank, but it's best to consider it a...a tad outdated. We should experiment with newer, better designers."
ENG_mechanization_effort:0 "Mechanization Efforts"
ENG_mechanization_effort_desc:0 "A truck can take you from point A to point B quite well. But without armor, they are terribly risk to use on a heavy battlefield. Add armor, create an armored personelle carrier, to bring our men to and from the front with as little harm as possible."
ENG_nottingham_tank:0 "Nottingham Tank School"
ENG_nottingham_tank_desc:0 "Large formations need officers, and we have never had tanks beyond a regiment. What of divisions? What of armies of tanks? How shall we coordinate the business of tanks? Infantry officers will not do for that task, and thus specific schools should be set up."
ENG_automobile_manufacturers:0 "Cooperate with Automobile Manufacturers"
ENG_automobile_manufacturers_desc:0 "Automobile manufacturers may be more interested in the civilian market. We should make them understand that we have a dire need, and a dire need that only they are qualified to fill."
ENG_intergration_tank_warfare:0 "Intergration of Tank Warfare"
ENG_intergration_tank_warfare_desc:0 "Tank warfare shall be an integrel part of British doctrine. Swift, steel, titans rolling thorugh the fields, crushing trees and laughing at barbed wire, annihilating pillboxes and crossing trenches with ease. No more shall the British soldier worry about charing a trench, for our tanks shall roll over all enemies!"
ENG_invest_radio:0 "Invest in Radio"
ENG_invest_radio_desc:0 "The Radio is a beautiful thing. It is almost a miracle, the progress made in the field. If we give govenrment subisdies to the Radio companies to help make military radios, then we'll never fall behind our enemies."
ENG_empire_wide_communications:0 "Empire Wide Communications"
ENG_empire_wide_communications_desc:0 "Canada, the Australias, Malay, we have soldiers from across the world. Formalizing command structures and communication between all soldiers across all our dominions and colonies will greatly benefit us during times of war."
ENG_tank_marines:0 "Tank Marines"
ENG_tank_marines_desc:0 "Tanks are not just a tool of the infantry. Landing on a beach is always a dangerous prospect, and our marines will quite need a bit of help when they are under fire. Armored cars, tanks, whatever we can make amphibious, would be most useful when we inevitably send our men to the beaches of Europe."
ENG_modify_production_lines:0 "Modify Production Lines"
ENG_modify_production_lines_desc:0 "We should tweak our production lines. No point in waste and excess, no point in defective gear or pointless testing. See how we can make our soldiers better, by making our production better."
ENG_combined_arms_force:0 "Combined Arms Forces"
ENG_combined_arms_force_desc:0 "An exposed infantryman may be struck down by a bullet, and a lone tank may be taken out by someone couragous enough to get close. Thus, either the tank nor the infantry may be supreme – they shall fight in tandem."
ENG_quality_quantity:0 "Quality over Quantity"
ENG_quality_quantity_desc:0 "Highly trained, elite soliders, professionals who know their job and turn killing into an efficent and brutal artform. That's what we need in the British army. Ten conscripts cannot replace one trained man, a hundred conscripts cannot exceed the ability of a squad who knows how to fight."
ENG_imporve_artillery:0 "Invest in Artillery"
ENG_imporve_artillery_desc:0 "Artillery is what killed in the Great War. Batteries of constantly-firing guns, drowning out larks and scarring the land. Men would be buried alive by whoever had superior numbers, and superior technology, in cannons. That shall be us, now and forever."
ENG_reconnaissance_companies:0 "Reconnaissance Companies"
ENG_reconnaissance_companies_desc:0 "Dedicated companies who can scout out vast swathes of land will be invaluable. With technology and trained men, we can take on any foe, but with a keen knowledge of the terrain, we will do so with a minimum of casualities."
ENG_fund_artillery_corps:0 "Fund Artillery Corps"
ENG_fund_artillery_corps_desc:0 "Increase the artillery corps funding, so they may get bigger, better, and more guns. The British cannon shall be feared by all who seek to harm the King's men, the King's land, and the King's honour."
ENG_cult_of_artillery:0 "Cult of Artillery"
ENG_cult_of_artillery_desc:0 "QF 6-pounders, battleship cannons, howizters, anything that goes bang is loved and welcome in this army. Anything that lets us aim at our enemies, and destroy their walls and their fortifications, knock down their towers and annihilate their men, from safely behind our own defenses, is quite welcome."
ENG_commonwealth_war_games:0 "Commonwealth War Games"
ENG_commonwealth_war_games_desc:0 "We do not expect to fight our dominions, but their soldiers and our soldiers may fight against a common enemy, and it that we must worry about. Wargames, military exercises, whatever it takes to train our men, we will do. New doctrines means new wargames, new wargames means better doctrine."
ENG_glorious_army:0 "A Glorious Army"
ENG_glorious_army_desc:0 "The British army stands proud once more, the defender of the Empire and the bright of light, liberty, and civilization in Europe! Long live the King!"

ENG_ECNB:0 "Expand Current Naval Bases"
ENG_ECNB_desc:0 "Our naval ambitions should not be limited any further. A lage navy requires better bases, better supply, better drydocks and repair facilities. We have the ports, but we must now expand them."
ENG_dockyard_buildup:0 "Dockyard Buildup"
ENG_dockyard_buildup_desc:0 "Building a ship is no easy task, it can take months, if not years, for a capital vessel to be brought up from plates of steel to a might beast. Reduce the strain on individual dockyards by building multiple, so each may focus wholly on whatever project we assign it."
ENG_protect_the_convoys:0 "Protect the convoys"
ENG_protect_the_convoys_desc:0 "In the Great War, we lost many ships and convoys to the Submarines of the German Empire. New tactics and ideas for protecting the valuable convoys are vital, for losing any of the convoys means that someone in Britain is deprived during war, be it of bacon or bullets."
ENG_blockade_preparations:0 "Blockade Preparations"
ENG_blockade_preparations_desc:0 "We must be prepared to be blockaded, in the worst case scenario, or to blockade others. Starving out a nation is a slow, painful, process best achieved with a navy, and without proper planning, it will inevitably fail."
ENG_sub_warfare:0 "Submarine Warfare"
ENG_sub_warfare_desc:0 "U-boats, or submarines, were devestating in the Great War. Expanding our use of them will be vital if we wish to keep up in the ongoing naval race. To strike from under the water, unseen, undetected, is an ability that once seemed to be a fantasy, one imagined by HG Wells. But now, it is reality."
ENG_a_global_force:0 "A Global Force"
ENG_a_global_force_desc:0 "We can extend the power of the British Empire throughout the oceans and seas of the world. From the coasts of New Zealand to the shores of Newfoundland, and our own Channel Islands, the British navy shall be able to respond to to any threat."
ENG_generation_battleships:0 "A new generation of battleships"
ENG_generation_battleships_desc:0 "Battleships are important, they decide naval battles, and have for centuries. We have no reason to assume this will change anytime soon. A new generation of battleships is in order."
ENG_listen_air_arm:0 "Listen to the Air Arm"
ENG_listen_air_arm:0 "The Air Arm has...unorthodox ideas. Entire vessels, stripped of offensive capabilities, and instead filled with planes. This would project power far, far, further than any gun, but at the same time, there are those in our ranks who feel it is a risk not worth taking. What do to?"
ENG_new_designs:0 "New Designs"
ENG_new_designs_desc:0 "New designs of battleships are vital, the dreadnoughts are outdated, and the technology is far better. If we wish to make a capital vessel, it must be with the newest of technology, the best of armor, the heaviest of guns."
ENG_battlecruiser_retrofit:0 "Battlecruiser Retrofit"
ENG_battlecruiser_retrofit_desc:0 "Battlecruisers can be fitted with larger guns and heavier armor, making them impromptu battleships that can serve as a stopgap measure as our new designs are created and planned out."
ENG_increase_firepower:0 "Increase Firepower"
ENG_increase_firepower_desc:0 "A cannon, no, a battery of cannons, each capable of shattering any other ship to smithereens, capable of bombing any coastal fortress into submission. That is the dream, that is the goal, and our engineers will work their damndest to make it into reality. The roar of British guns shall be felt, the Lion of Britannia shall awaken on the seas once more!"
ENG_modernise_destroyer_fleet:0 "Modernise Destroyer Fleet"
ENG_modernise_destroyer_fleet_desc:0 "Destroyers are escorts for our true power. Preventing torpedo boats, submarines, and other quite undesirable things from getting close and scuttling our mighty battleships. After all, even a lone lion will be felled should it be caught unawares. Destroyers are there to act as extra eyes."
ENG_a_true_capital_ship:0 "A True Capital Ship"
ENG_a_true_capital_ship_desc:0 "A true, new, capital ship, worthy of King, of Country, of the Glorious British Empire! It is a pride and joy, a steel testament to our rising power!"
ENG_accomodate_new_tactics:0 "Accomodate New Tactics"
ENG_accomodate_new_tactics_desc:0 "Try the new tactics out. Who knows, maybe this won't be a a disaster. Carriers, they call them. Aircraft carriers."
ENG_war_games:0 "Naval War Games"
ENG_war_games_desc:0 "New tactics require new ideas, new ideas require new wargames. These 'carriers' are interesting, but they must be tested extensively before we can approve them in any major capacity. However, the skepticism seems to be fading from the ranks of the navy."
ENG_naval_bombers:0 "Naval Bombers"
ENG_naval_bombers_desc:0 "Bombers, entirely based from and meant to attack naval targets, are lighter, and don't carry as much  as our land-orientated bombers. But one must admit, seeing a 250kg bomb drop with near pinpoint accuracy is something terrifying, and one can only imagine what it could do if it hit a proper ship."
ENG_carrier_buildup:0 "Carrier Buildup"
ENG_carrier_buildup_des:0 "Give the go-ahead to start constructing dedicated carriers – this new technology is something we must capitalize on, and build a fleet based around them before anyone else."
ENG_an_evolving_navy:0 "An evolving navy"
ENG_an_evolving_navy_desc:0 "Our navy is evolving, changing quickly. Good. To be stagnant is to be left behind. To refuse to change is to accept death later on."
ENG_new_naval_constructions:0 "New Naval Constructions"
ENG_new_naval_constructions_desc:0 "With our latest Naval advancments, new shipyards will be needed to support our existing navy and build new and improved ships. We need new dockyards all over the United Kingdom, for King and Country"
ENG_we_rule_the_waves:0 "We Rule the waves"
ENG_we_rule_the_waves_desc:0 "Rule Brittania, Britannia rules the waves. We shall never, ever, be slaves. With our navy, we stand strong, and with our ships, we shall protect our island home forever."

ENG_new_theatre:0 "New Theatre of War"
ENG_new_theatre_desc:0 "Into the sky, into the sky! From fighters to bombers, immune to the artillery and machineguns that so chop up infantry, the theater of war that was so violently blown open by the Great War, the theater of the sky, is ripe for exploitation."
ENG_upgrade_air_bases:0 "Upgrade Air Bases"
ENG_upgrade_air_bases_desc:0 "Our airbases should be expanded, to fuel, support, and repair more planes. It's not hard to make a runway, it's not difficult to make a hanger. It's time we gave the air arm the respect and funding it deserves."
ENG_royal_paratrooper_core:0 "Royal Paratrooper Corps"
ENG_royal_paratrooper_core_desc:0 "Men jumping from planes has happened, of course. Mostly in accidents, and often without paracutes. But now, paracuting men can jump safely, land, and act as light infantry. They won't be well supported, but the shock value of enemies landing behind the defensive line will be quite useful."
ENG_air_defence:0 "Air Defence"

ENG_glasgow_to_london_railway_desc:0 "The most stark divide in this nation is not based on geography, but class, which in turn has influenced the North-South divide in this nation. The wealthy, London-based bankers had no interest in the North of England or Scotland beyond using their people to work in factories.

As such we will construct an ambitious railway from the capital to the core of Scottish industry, connecting workers and industry across the entire Isle."

eng.1.t:0 "History of the United Kingdom"
eng.1.d:0 "The United Kingdom entered the Great War fully confident in its abilities to best any foe, it left the war humbled and injured. Prime Minister Herbert Asquith led the United Kingdom to victory thanks to his son while being gravely injured, survived and gave him the strength to fight of David Lloyd George challenge.\n\n While ultimately victorious, defeat on the Western Front and major losses at the Somme and the Dardanelles campaign caused Britain to retreat into an isolationist attitude as revolutions and fear gripped the world. The twenties for Britain would be the opposite of the great war, a time of peace and relative prosperity, the victory of the Labour Party in the 1926 election over the recently elected conservative government of 1922 caused a small welfare state to form and lives for the common man improved. Led by Arthur Henderson, Britain continued unchanged while the world shifted around it.\n\n This time of peace and prosperity would be stopped in 1931, where Arthur Henderson was assassinated by a French facist and riots consumed Britain. The Labour party unable to deal with the issues lost in the 1931 election to the Conservative party led by Austen Chamberlain who quickly formed a national unity government to tackle the problem. With problems on the mainland, issues in the colonies expanded and grew out of control, culminating in the Indian revolt of 1934 and fall of the British Raj. The National Unity Government would be unable to deal with these problems and in 1934 when the british stock markets crumbled due to the revolt, it took down the world economy with it.\n\n With the government entering 1936, Austen Chamberlain has called a snap election to end the parliamentary deadlock, will Britain recover and resume its place on the world stage, or will the British Lion finally be driven to extinction. "
eng.1.a:0 "The English Lion Marches on!"
eng.2.t:0 "Parliament Breaks for Election Season"
eng.2.d:0 "Today is officially the day parliament breaks for the campaign season. As is customary of all elections, parliament shall be dismissed until the elections end, in which they shall be invited back for a new session. Quite boring on most days, but this one was particularly important, as Prime Minister Austin Chamberlain announced that he will be resigning. His rule has been contested by liberals, Labour and even his fellow Tories, so the announcement of the end of his reign has been met with numerous people scurrying to get ahold of power. One must imagine Chamberlain happy for leaving now."
eng.2.a:0 "And so, the race begins."
eng.3.t:0 "The 1936 Snap Election"
eng.3.d:0 " At last, the election is here. Labour, the Liberals and the Tories have been working around the clock in order to ensure that they secure victory in the election. People from all across the country have come to place their vote for the party of their choice, as the future of Britain for the years to come will be decided by this. The Tories are quite confident in another victory, but the Liberals and Labour are just as confident in usurping them and beginning the transition to a new way of doing politics."
eng.3.a:0 "Labour! We'll keep the red flag flying here!"
eng.3.b:0 "The Liberals! Why should we be beggars, with the ballot in our hand!"
eng.3.c:0 "The Tories! God, who made thee mighty, make thee mightier yet!"
eng.4.t:0 "Anger at Rearmament"
eng.4.d:0 "While many interventionist and imperialist MPs and intellectuals have been in support of the Royal Rearmament proclamation, others have been outraged. Just today in London, over ten thousand people marched through the streets with anti-war signs and chanting music and slogans as they went in opposition. Police were at the scene to monitor the event in the case of either violent activity or communist activity, but luckily there was little in the way of either. What is of note was a speech by Labour Party MP George Lansbury, who has been outspoken in his anti-war views from the start. He condemned the government for what he called their “policy of walking headfirst into another pointless war on the mainland”, and criticized Winston Churchill in particular, saying that “one should expect no better from a man who confesses to have loved the war.” His speech was quite popular amongst the crowd, but whether it will have any effect on the public at large will have to be seen."
eng.4.a:0 "Can someone shut Lansbury up?"
eng.5.t:0 "Riot in Calais"
eng.5.d:0 "Ever since the futurists and nationalist parties took control of France, we have seen a pretty large influx of refugees from the country, ranging from political opponents to business elites to, well, anyone with their head screwed on correctly. That, and our occupation of Calais, has made the futurist government very angry, and has done everything in their power to bring down our rule. Their propaganda portrays us as attempting to bring British rule to the northern states of France, much like how it was before the Hundred Years War, and they’ve actively funded rebel groups in the region. Just today, pro-futurist groups clashes violently with numbers of refugees trying to flee the country. Calling them cowards, these radicals asserted that Le Patron would be ashamed of their treachery, and they began to assault one of the groups of them. This would snowball into a quite large riot, with police working all day to arrest every single instigator and rebel. No one was killed, thank God, but many were wounded, and many are calling the government’s ability to handle the refugee crisis into question. Thankfully, we have many people now awaiting trial for the incident, so hopefully this keeps the public quiet for at least some time."
eng.5.a:0 "Sometimes, I really do hate this job."

eng.6.t:0 "The Bren Light Machine Gun"
eng.6.d:0 "The gun roared as its user fired at the targets, its bullets sailing through and hitting vital points. The generals on the side took notes as they watched it and its user, Vaclav Holek. Holek, a Czech gun designer, had been invited to Britain to demonstrate and discuss his Vz. 52 light machine gun, which had impressed the British greatly. The British copy of the weapon, known as the Bren, is quickly becoming more popular than the classic Lewis gun, and with Europe heating up, the army knows how foolish it would be to turn down someone like Holek. The Bren gun uses a 30 round box magazine and can be fired from both a prone and a standing position. It fires a .303 round, and is shorter and lighter than the Lewis gun. The generals were consistently impressed with Holek’s display, and after much talk, Holek was hired as a producer and designer of weaponry for the army.

Claude didn’t understand how the Scottish lived in these mountains for so many years. “Goddamn, the Highlands are a nightmare! How about now?!” He aggravatedly asked. “Much better, Claude. What’s your location?” The sergeant asked. The soldier looked around for any recognizable landmarks, but started to panic a little when he realized there weren’t any.\n\n“Uh, sir? I don’t know where I am.” He said quietly. The sergeant sighed. “Christ in heaven. Alright, I’ll gather a team, and we’ll be on our way. Don’t move anywhere and stay on the walkie talkie, understood?” “Yes, sir.” The soldier said. He sat on the rocks overlooking the plains, and stared up into the skies, breathing deeply in order to relax. He notices two flashing lights in the sky, and the plane that carried them. Or, was it a plane? He wasn’t sure. Claude felt nervous looking at it; it moved faster than any normal plane, and its wings were shaped differently than the ones he’d seen at home. He stared at it for at least an hour, trying to understand what it was doing and what it even was.\n\nWhen the sergeant arrived, Claude pointed out the plane to him. The men didn’t have a clue; when they arrived back, the sergeant informed his superiors about the plane, only to be told that there were no scheduled flights at that time. It could have been a spy plane, of course, but they didn't have any idea as to what it was."

eng.8.t:0 " Learning From The Somme"
eng.8.d:0 "The Great War helped to shatter all previous conceptions of military strategy in just a few years. The technological terror of machine guns, gas and mass artillery created a bloodbath the world had never witnessed before, and sadly, we walked right into it without a clue as to what to do. Now, years after the war, we are still trying to learn from it all. \n\nThree main proposals now stand. The first, from general J. F. C. Fuller, argues that the army should adopt a strategy based around speed and mobility, and he had been an adamant proponent of armored warfare and mechanized infantry. His ties to Pro-French futurist groups, however, has made many weary. The second comes from B. H. Liddel Hart, who has said that the Great War has taught us that the future of warfare will be mostly defensive, and that the army should focus on refining tactics for defending the empire and working on how to actually plan well when attack come. This argument, while popular amongst some, has been criticized for its total rejection of maneuver or the ability for technology to change the way a battle is fought. Finally, Alan Brooke has argued that the army should focus on overwhelming firepower in order to completely shatter and destroy the enemy forces. His theories are popular amongst artillerymen, but the proposers of Fuller’s plan believe that victory can be achieved without total destruction.\n\nWhatever one picks, it is important to remember that the lives of every single soldier in the army, and the lives of those on the home front, lays in the hands of the generals. The Somme was not just a strategic failure, but a moral one, and those who choose doctrine better have a damn good reason as to why they picked what they did."

In other words, people learn better when it is made into a game. The same goes with military affairs, and there is no better time to see this in action than the Commonwealth War Games. All of the empire’s best officers and a good portion of their men are invited to participate in simulations of actual combat, in order to refine their skills and learn how to adapt. After all, it's better to learn in the safety of the exercises than in the middle of combat.\n\nLast year, the officers participated in a theoretical stand-off with the Germans, played by volunteers with terrible impressions of the German accent. This year, they fought the French, who had even worse accents (how they get worse every year we will never know). The simulation was a theoretical defense of Calais, wherein the British had to hold off against waves of French attacks until reinforcements arrived. The French fought with a mixture of mass wave assaults with infantry and quick maneuvers with the armored corps. The British officers did quite well, but they were eventually overwhelmed and defeated. The loss didn’t matter too much; for one thing, our officers now have a much better idea as to what is expected of them in live combat. Individual failings were few and far between; most of the issues came down to general coordination and the stress of combat.\n\nWhen it comes to the French devils, one can never be too prepared.

The Britannia bears nine 46cm guns; the largest guns ever put on a warship. The purpose of this is twofold; to blow any opposing ships skyhigh, and to assist troops engaged in naval landings or regular combat.

There, they will be assigned to evacuation camps and raised by government caretakers, where they will try to make life as normal and bearable as possible.

As Lord Nelson once said, “Every man must do his duty.” The problem, however, is that just because they must, doesn’t mean it will work. The Home Guard, militia units formed in case of a naval invasion of the main isles, are mostly made up of reservists and old men, and haven’t exactly gotten the equipment they need.\n\nThe Home Guard is made up of 1,682,000 volunteers. They had 847,000 rifles, 47,000 shotguns and 49,000 machine guns of various kinds. All of this sounds good, until you realize that this meant that 739,000 men had no weapons whatsoever. The Prime Minister, outraged by this, wrote to the Home Office and said that “every man must have a weapon of some sort, be it only a mace or a pike”. The Home Office clearly didn’t understand the joke, because they ordered from the Ministry of Aircraft Production over 250,000 pikes, made out long steel tubes with old bayonets jammed at the ends.\n\nMany are quick to laugh at this, but in a way, there is some hope to be found in this. The Home Guard were eager to train with them, meaning that they’re fine fighting in close quarters combat, as long as they had some kind of equipment.

eng.15.d:0 "While many involved with British politics have been content to merely use parliament to pass reforms (or to stop their passing), some have believed that they must use “other” methods to attain power. Archibald Maule Ramsay, a Scottish MP turned far-right anti-semite, has been a leading figure in Britain’s accelerationist movement. Along with the tomboyish monarchist Rotha Lintorn-Orman and the radical propagandist William Joyce, they had made up what liberal and socialist newspapers called the “Devil’s Triumvirate”; the product of French accelerationism combined with British patriotism and a hatred of Jews and other people deemed foreign to the fatherland they would kill for. So when this group proposed a march through the historically Jewish neighborhood of Cable Street, people were naturally suspicious. Letting them around Jews would be like letting the Japanese generals take a stroll through Chinatown; it's not a matter of “if” a fight breaks out, but a matter of “when”. So the people of Cable Street protested; they didn’t want this kind of violence to come to their homes, and they’d happily fight them if they tried anything. This leaves the Triumvirate in a bit of an odd position. They don’t want to incur the wrath of the government and the people; Ramsay’s experience as an MP has told him that anti-democratic movements still need the people to support. But they also don’t want to look weak; how embarrassing would it be for the movement calling Jews inferior to be repelled by their complaining? Finally, after much discussion. The Triumvirate came to a decision."

He had sung the praises of the Anglo-Saxon race and their resistance to Jewish and Marxist ideas and temptations, and now he had no other choice but to bend the knee. The British accelerationist movement’s leadership felt as though they weren’t ready for a movement of this nature, and that as sad as this would be, it would be worth it in the long wrong. So Ramsay wrote an open letter to the people of Cable Street, criticizing their intolerance to his ideas and warned them that “this kind of authoritarianism would make Britain look like Germany in just a few short years”. And the people of Cable Street chuckled a bit, shrugged their shoulders and went back to their work. But the Devil’s Triumvirate was far from done. Rather than march there, they instead turned their attention to Liverpool, where the reception was far less hostile. The march would be led by Rotha Lintorn-Orman, would would give a speech on the counterproductive nature of parliament and affirm the power of the king. Everything went well for them; resistance was minor, and the bobbies and blackshirts kept any hostile protestors at bay. Rotha’s speech was good, but some are concerned for her. She slurred a bit in her speaking; to be polite, her frequent drug usage is no secret amongst the leadership or the rank and file of the movement."

Neighborhood leaders worked with Independent Labour Party officials, communist agitators, anarchist fighters, Irish dockworkers, British Jews and many others in order to put up a fight. The Metropolitan has sent a detachment of the police to keep the peace, and the blackshirts have been preparing melee weapons for the fight. This would be a bloodbath. As soon as the marchers walked upon the street, they started to clash with the counter protestors, who had built a barricade in order to stop the march. All sorts of weapons were used; sticks, rocks, chair legs, rotten food, cricket bats. If it existed, it was weaponized. The police charged the barricade in order to break up the fight, and brutally smacked down the residents with force.  The police are now questioning whether to stop the march or to fight against the protestors.  "

With their main opposition routed and fleeing, they could triumphantly strut and goose step throughout Cable Street, and then wherever they pleased. After all of that, they ended the march with speeches from the three leaders“In the face of it all, Britain has survived, and she shall continue to.” Said Orman. “But I want this nation and her empire to flourish, not merely to carve out a meager existence. And as long as the talking shop in Westminister exists, then it shall never flourish. Authority comes not from politicians, but from the throne!” Her speeches resonated with an ultra loyalist sect within the movement. Ramsay played up the anti-semtic rhetoric, damning the Jews “for securing our loss in the war”, and promised a Britain free of “Judeo-Councilist influence”. Finally, Joyce called for a more aggressive foreign policy. “Britain is an empire, and an empire it shall remain. For war and conquest is the very thing that makes our Anglo-Saxon empire glorious and desirable. This has been a great day for the far-right, and a nightmare for everyone else.

They would fight! And fight they did. He and a few loyal paramilitaries charged upon isolated protestors, clubbing and beating them while they were down. The more organized anti-accelerationists grouped up and fought back, but this really scared the public. This scuffle snowballed into a riot, and it travelled throughout London. By this time, Ramsay and Orman were far away, thankful that they weren’t connected in any way. The police worked overtime to bring calm to the city, cracking down hard on curfews and public gathering until finally, the dust settled. Needless to say, the people of Britain are not enthusiastic about Ramsay and his crew. In their mind, they really are the “Devil’s Triumvirate”. "

According to inside sources, the sailors met and voted on whether they would go on strike or not. The admiral and his men tried to stop the meeting, but they weren’t able to, and now that the strike is on the way, they have decided to stay uninvolved with either side.

Thankfully, no one was killed, but a few were injured, and have been brought to hospital immediately.

While the dominions in Australia, Canada and New Zealand have been able to prevent revolt through careful reform and the creation of an imperial patriotism, our governments in Africa, Madras and the East Indies have been lucky to survive as long as they have.\n\n To put it simply, we will need drastic reform if we want to survive in the years ahead. Our reputation as a world power is dwindling as well. Ever since we lost the Great War, our reputation as an unbeatable, world spanning empire has started to crumble. Instead, many see us as the Austrians, with a crumbling multi-ethnic empire being towed along by bigger and better powers. We will have to do much to repair our reputation. The seas are stormy ahead, but if we keep are heads and push through, we can make it. "

eng.34.d:0 "Edward VIII’s life as King has been a hectic and chaotic one. Taking the throne after his father’s death from Septicemia in 1927, Edward was in many ways still young in his manners and mindset. While his many advisors encouraged him to find a wife and to ensure the stability of the country and the legitimacy of the monarchy, he had no interest in it. Instead, he spent his time with his countless mistresses, to the dismay of the more conservative minded of the royal family and parliament. Most notably amongst them was Thelma Furness, a socialite and close companion of Edward.\n\n But the childish antics and fast living would come to an end when Edward met Pamela Mitford. The young king found here more charming and attractive than his many mistresses, and after much talk and discussion, it was decided that they would be married. This was met with the conservatives collectively thank the heavens for the boy to finally have some sense, and the royal family was happy to see the mistress's gone.\n\nIt was also an interesting choice of partner; the Mitford sisters were well known for their political involvement, with Nancy being an MP for Labour, Jessica being a fellow traveller to the Communists, and Diana being a high-ranking figure in the far-right Nordic League. Pamela was the least politically involved out of all of them, which was another factor that made the royal family appreciate his choice.\n\nThe wedding will be held during June this year, and is expected to be attended by thousands of people and many important political figures."

eng.35.d:0 "Edward’s father was convinced that in only six months, he would ruin his reputation and be forced out of politics and British affairs entirely. Edward was proud that he could stick it to the old man after all this time.\n\nHe and his newly-wed, Pamela Mitford, walked down the halls of St George’s Chapel while the people cheered and the aristocrats, politicians and royals bowed for their king. After a brief ceremony, Pamela Mitford was made the wife of Edward and Queen, an honor bestowed on very few.\n\nThe Mitford family had sent numerous wedding gifts to them both in celebration, and they often carried political connotations in regards to what they wanted King Edward to be. Jessica Mitford, a communist, sent a Brazillian copy of The Communist Manifesto, which had an ornately decorated front cover. Diana Mitford sent a copy of her good friend J. F. C. Fuller’s book The Foundations of the Science of War, which placed an emphasis on speed and mobility. Diana even left a note in it saying that “a leader needs to know how to fight, as all politics is violence harnessed by the state”. Nancy sent some wine and a Labour Party songbook, and Unity had a record of Richard Wagner’s greatest works sent. The sisters were not merely interested in just congratulating their sister; they saw the fate of Britain in their hands.\n\nThe wedding has repaired Edward’s reputation amongst many of his skeptics (or at least kept them silent), and his duties as a husband will hopefully help him settle down for now. In the meantime, it's back to politics."

eng.36.d:0 "Many within the government believe that, at long last, Edward has cleaned up his act. The once rebellious and libertine youth has become a respectable adult ready to lead the nation, all thanks to his love of Pamela Mitford.\n\nBut if one listens elsewhere, to the papers or the tabloids or even street talk, one hears a different story altogether. One hears a story about how nothing really has changed.\n\nThere are some who claim that Edward has not left his mistresses. People claim to have seen Thelma Furness still with him, arms locked and walking to quiet hotels and shady back alleys.\n\nThis is obviously weird to those who pay attention; didn’t he abandon her for Mitford? What was the point of the marriage?\n\nIt only gets stranger from there; people have confronted Pamela about this, and all her responses seem to indicate a lack of care. She insists that the two are “just friends” and that people should respect their privacy, but other than that she comes off as indifferent to the whole thing.  This could all be just rumours, of course. The tabloids are hardly reliable, and the newspapers are often not much better. Still, to call this worrying would be an understatement."

While many have been confused and intrigued by the suggestions that the King was still seeing other women, his wife, Pamela Mitford, came off as uninterested at best. This made people only more unsure; what on earth is going on here? Now, however, some people are really in the loop.\n\nPamela has a friend named Giuditta Tommasi. An Italian horsewoman and quite athletic, she has been found to be in the company that Pamela keeps around. But, well, it’s more than that. Pamela and her are suspected to be deeply in love; reporters have seen them entering the same hotels Edward has checked into with his mistress, which is a pretty sure sign.\n\nAttempts to speak on this have ended quite badly, however; when one reporter accused Pamela of being a homosexual, Edward fired back and called him a “good for nothing presshound spouting claims with no substance”.  Needless to say, this rumour has been kept under wraps; homosexuality is a crime under the law, and the reputation hit the royal family could take would be nasty.\n\nBut Edward and Pamela are quite happy; they both needed each other as friends and as solutions to problems, and once that was done, they have pursued new partners. Maybe all is quiet within the family."

While some figures on the right such as  MP Archibald Ramsay criticised the bill saying that it was a direct attack on freedom, members from the conservatives, liberals and Labour all voted together against Ramsays hypocrisy and voted for a better Britain.

eng.39.d:0 "To say that this hasn’t been our finest year would be putting it politely. Our economy is completely in the dumps, thanks to both the worldwide economic downturn and the specific situation within India. We’re buying more foreign goods and producing less home goods, meaning that were buying more than were making, which is not good for deindustrialized nations like ours. On top of that this has spurred rebel activity to a serious and worrying degree. Granted, Lord John Ersinke and Orde Wingate have done well in suppressing rebellions across the country. Wingate’s “chindits” are well-trained for fighting in rough climate and have beaten back the rebels wherever they may be, and Ersinke has worked hard to see the army reform itself into something resembling a regular army. But that won’t be enough; Travancore is giving large amounts of funding to these groups, and dissent is mounting by the hour. Now is the time we act, or else we suffer the consequences. "

Off your ass and on your feet!” The decision to abandon the Madras presidency was not a cautious decision made by careful and rational politicians, but a rushed and chaotic move by an empire in decay. Hope had been lost in the region, and now, it was time to leave. All British army, navy and air force men had to leave before nighttime, and they would have to cram every man and piece of equipment onto the ships taking them away. Soldiers quickly scurried about, grabbing their belongings and running to either their company’s ship or just wherever had room. One person would mess up and go on the wrong ship, leaving no room for the next guy, who would have to take the wrong boat, and so on and so forth. Madness was the order of the day. Finally, at 6:00 at night, the last British soldier left the territory. Other than a few flags left about and the lingering legacy of colonial rule, the British were gone from Madras. The people celebrated in response, happy that they were free of their rule. The Tories and old fashioned imperialists have had to grit their teeth during this entire affair, mad and frustrated that it had to end this way. A whole chapter of British history ends, and a new one begins, with the image of soldiers hanging onto the sides of planes and ships on the front page. "

In order to do this, Operation London Bridge was devised.  London Bridge, as the name suggests, is creating infrastructure and an entire supply network so that the government can get more troops and equipment. Supply has been a nightmare here, so any remedy to it is always welcome, and more troops and equipment is also necessary. The British engineer corps shall construct bridges, roads and pathways for the new flood of troops, and in return the Madras government shall pay us back in the future. Let’s hope this pays off. "

Assisted by air power, naval bombardment and mass artillery strikes, our infantry shall move forth and re-occupy every bit of territory taken by the usurpers. No cheeky maneuvers, no clever offensive, just one massive push assisted by the might of the armed forces of all the Empire. All shall have to render under Caesar. The anti-colonialists, both at home and abroad, shall complain about this. They shall whine about the inhumanity of our government, or the freedom of the natives. But the troops are on their way; nothing stops the guns of the empire. Britain is a master because it refuses to be a slave; it does not bend to anyone, for any reason. Forwards, men!

The air is filled with the sounds of our bands, playing only the finest patriotic tunes, and the cannons are roaring in celebration of this great day.

eng.44.d:0 "Controversial Chinese Emperor-turned-Movie Director, Henry Aisin Gioro, has recently released a slapstick comedy about a simple court eunuch. This flick, hilariously comedic and sickeningly violent, has the titular, childishly malicious Wu causing deep emotional torment to those around him much to the enjoyment of the painfully naïve emperor. One particularly brutal moment was the castrated elderly baking and serving a cake filled with broken glass and needles to other eunuchs of the court. Critics have dismissed the work as stupid nonsense and frankly disgusting, however those most loyal to the director have claimed the movie has far more to it that first thought and claim that the movie is an apology from the artist formerly known as Puyi directed to his own eunuchs."

eng.45.d:0 "Henry Aisin Gioro has created a new dramatic movie based on a gritty depiction of Britain's local Chinatowns. The plot of the movie starts with a white Londoner coming to Chinatown to look for \"entertainment\" as he goes through the various streets of the lightened neighborhood, slowly walking around with dramatic music playing in the background as he finds a Shanghainese-origin prostitute, who subsequently courts the white man to her apartment, a moldy and dirty place - and, in the height of the sexual tension, the man begins strangling the woman and slowly kills her, with immense struggle and violence, resulting in a bloody enviroment. This movie has been interpreted as the view of the Western World of not only Chinese people in Europe, but of China as a nation, with the woman representing China and the white man representing Europe. Many have asked Henry why was the woman killed, and he replies \"You don't care when it happens in real life, why do you care when it happens in the movie?\"."

There are those that claim this violent, and dramatized account of the life of the French Patron Artaud will inspire violence among disenfranchised young men and call for the Board of Censors to ban this movie. But then there is the other wing of critics who have already called this deeply psycholgical look at what happens when you cross the downtrodden and mentally disturbed with a deeply unjust society as Henry's magnum opus - \"a gut wrenching, character driven kino, an exquisite choice\" as one critic described it. It is without a doubt the most impressive movie of his career. Drawing on his experiences writing Echoes of Chengdu and Red Lights of Chinatown - Henry has seemingly pulled off the impossible: merging Shakespearean tragedy and Chaplinesque humour into what can only be described as the darkest of comedies."

After this, flowers appear on the screen where the blood used to be, and colors spring up from an increasingly darkening background where former sounds of shooting and high-caliber weapons could be heard. As more sounds come, more flowers appear, some with different colors - all mixed in with the sounds of pain, horror, and violence. The movie eventually ends with the sounds of common German imperial songs such as \"Schwarzbraun ist die Haselnuss\" and British imperial songs, then shows many bloodied flags flying in the wind. Many believe the film is an enactment of the Boxer Rebellion, but they aren't too sure."
