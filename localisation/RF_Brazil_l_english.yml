BRA_DESC_MENU:0 "Brazil is a beacon of the Internationale, yet a fragile one. After the Pajama Revolution in late 1935 crushed the collapsing old republic under Armando Salles, the First Revolutionary Council is coming and people across the country are plotting to reach their ideal goals. What shall be the future of the Coffee Nation, the great giant in South America which is breaking apart at the seams?"

#LEADER DESCRITIONS#
POLITICS_Anarchy_DESC:0 "With the civilian government collapsing into regional fighting oligarchs, all semblance of a central government has turned into a abstraction of itself."
POLITICS_AQUINO_DESC:0 "Born in Cuiabá, Mato Grosso, in 1885, Francisco Aquino de Correia S.D.B, has had a profound impact on the society around him, representing the poorest in Brazil's western areas like Cuiabá, Porto Velho, and Rio Branco. As an important Mato-Grossense poet and writer, he became extremely influential with the religious poor across the country with his egalitarian message, and with the Pajama Revolution, he helped secure the countryside of the Mato Grosso, Rondônia and Amazon area by rallying local priests, being an Archbishop, and calling for a crusade against the oligarchs of Brazil. He has since then called for the creation of a peaceful Brazil that seeks to help the poorest through Catholic values, and yet maintain moderation in social policy. He has had a profound impact in the development of culture in the area, aswell as having political experience through his governance of Mato Grosso in 1918 to 1922. Now, he finds himself at the top of the Brazilian Council of Salvation after being elected for his profound social and religious message which appealed to the poorest of Brazil, and now he shall develop his ideas according to his utopian and poetic views."
POLITICS_AMAZONAS_DESC:0 "Born in Belém, Pará, Amazonas is a very new figure to the socialist political situation that Brazil finds itself in, but the timing was perfect; he became involved with the Communist Party of Brazil, one of the first and last remaining communist parties in the world after the failure of the Russian Revolution, he found himself in an increasingly libertarian surrounding, and then, with the Pajama Revolution, he quickly got to work helping the PCdoB rise up against the Government in the Pará-Northeast area, and helped urban areas in the Northeast rise up against the oligarchs which held them for decades in near-slavery, or basically slavery, and he went to work in ensuring that the Vanguardist voice wouldn't be silenced by the vile Syndicalists which plagued the Conselho de Salvação Nacional. As a Marxist and Leninist, he believes deeply in the creation of a Bolshevik State like the one in Russia and sees it as the most correct expression of socialism, and believes that it is only through radical totalitarianism and militancy that Brazil can come towards the twentieth century kicking and screaming, and wipe away the oligarchs which have long opressed it's society for over a century since the country's independence."
#IDEAS#
BRA_oligarchic_madness:0 "Oligarchic Madness"
BRA_oligarchic_madness_desc:0 "A lot of the political power in Brazil is not in elected officials or military commanders, but in regional colonels that have their own feudal fiefdoms, militias and in some cases, currencies. This state of affairs needs to be changed for Brazil to prosper."
BRA_local_army:0 "Local Army Structures"
BRA_local_army_desc:0 "The Brazilian army does not really exist as an institution. Instead each state has it's own army controlled by the local governor and supporting oligarchs: infighting and de-standartization is a common result of this structural autonomy."
BRA_revolutionary_scars:0 "Revolutionary Scars"
BRA_revolutionary_scars_desc:0 "The Pajama Coup left a large amount of ressentment, fear and hatred towards our government. We need to win the hearts and minds of the people for Brazil properly function as a revolutionary republic."
BRA_famine:0 "Famines"
BRA_famine_desc:0 "Famine has always been present in Brazil, but it has become so commonplace in the northeast that it is accepted as the normal state of affairs."

BRR_barroso:0 "Barroso is victorious."
BRR_oswald:0 "Oswald de Andrade is victorious."
BRR_eternalleader:0 "Eternal Leader"

brazil.1.title:0 "The Pajama Revolution"
brazil.1.desc:0 "When a clique of pro slavery military officers launched a coup against the Brazilian Emperor Pedro II in 1889, none of them could have expected what was to come in the following decades. Since 1889 Brazil had been an oligarchic republic ruled from the states o Minas Geraes and São Paulo, known as the coffee and milk Republic, marked by instability, short lived dictatorships (Deodoro, Floriano and Arthur Bernardes), civil strife, racism and a overall nonexistence of central government. Authority was applied by the local oligarchs and landowners with their own militias and interests in mind, creating a pressure that moved ever closer to exploding into full-scale civil war.\n\nIn 1930 the acting oligarch, Washington Luís, contemplated the possibility of creating a national unity government to revitalize the decaying system, but instead decided to continue the old coffee and milk policy by appointing Antonio Carlos de Andrada, a politician from Minas Geraes as the next country president. The Andrada government was plagued by the same civil strife of the 1910s and 1920s with aggravation coming from the rising left wing tenentistas of the army, a threat dismissed by the ruling oligarchy who appointed his last president in 1934, Armando Salles de Oliveira, who would rule for one year alone.\n\nOn November 23 of 1935 the Pajama Revolution began in Rio de Janeiro. An event planned months prior began with soldiers of the 3rd Infantry Regiment cutting the throats of their still sleeping roommates before seizing of the capital, under the command of the controversial - and also brutal - Filinto Muller, the mind behind the revolution. Similar uprisings happened in Natal and Recife in the north, while Luís Carlos Prestes led his own armed revolution in Rio Grande do Sul. By the end of December Armando Salles and other figures of the government embarked on the dreadnought Minas Geraes and fled to the USA, where a powerless government in exile was set up.\n\nBrazil in January 1936 is a new socialist republic, though what the future holds is unknown. As the remnants of the old order plan their own conspiracies, it is up to the new government to unite under a new faction and guide the prosperous, progressive Republic to the future."

brazil.2.t:0 "The Wake of the Revolution"
brazil.2.desc:0 "It has been a short few months since the Pajama Revolution and the Communist coup d'etat of the Federal government. There has been no major outburst of conflict, owing largely to the extremely decentralised nature of the Brazilian administration. The Communists of varying breeds ousted rivals in their own regions, while the oligarchs in the south and northeast were left relatively untouched. Even Filinto Müller, the German-trained mastermind of the Revolution, is not monolithic amongst the communists as his relationship with the Germans worries many moderates.\n\nAll the leaders of the various left-wing militias at least agree that a congress is necessary to ensure the survival and stability of the new revolutionary republic."

Amazonas suggests using a former Government building (one of the few not severly damaged by the revolution at least) which will certainly give a sense of normalcy and allow Amazonas's forces to secure the premises easier. Strangely, a group of Priests and religious leaders who spoke in favour of the revolution, lead largely by Francisco de Aquino Correia, have suggested using a local Cathedral to host the Council, believing no good Brazilian would dare attack holy ground."

Prestes has suggested allowing non-communist Trade Union and Worker Council leaders to be present, believeing that they can be turned to our cause. Amazonas takes a hardline stance and believes that no non-Communists beyond the most influential regional leaders should be present. Once again, Correia's clique of Priests petitions to be given permission to give speeches at the Council, and perhaps stand as delegates for their parishes. The foolish notion of allowing anyone to appear at the Council was raised, but quickly rejected by Amazonas and Prestes' groups."

There is still a general air of tension in the capital and even socialist-aligned militias are mistrusting of other militias, unsure whether one will attempt to cut their throats as in the initiation of the revolution. Prestes believes that a show of unity by employing various Workers' and Soldiers' Militias to guard the Council will be beneficial. Amazonas suggested of course that his elite Red Guard should be the sole guardians of the Council, which was fervently argued over by the other leaders. Amazonas suggested a compromise, utilising the former state police, a neutral entity, to guard nearby points of interest while loyal cardes of guards are allowed for each delegate."

Antônio was previously suspicious of the Godless Socialists, but since they had been good to the Church he didn’t really mind their presence. They were in a far away city that in no way shape or form impacted his home state of Pará. Antônio enjoyed to keep up on the news, as a way for him to know that life existed outside of his small Seminary in Terraverde, besides, his literacy was to be considered a gift in Brazil, and who was he to not use it? But one day brought a different headline, with words like 'Blood”, 'Fear”, 'Terror”, 'Death”, and most importantly, 'Revolution”. Antônio had a very hard time after that.\n His teachers being taken away, his parents of moderate wealth being stripped of their land rights and forced to work in the mines, he and his class mates having to go through ruthless interrogation after ruthless interrogation, with Antônio having to lie about his social and economic positions to save his life. Life had become very hard for poor Antônio, forced to watch as his life drained away in front away from his eyes. Until one day it was all gone. As he went up to the seminarinal steps one last time, a Red Guard militia blocked his entrance. This was enough for Antônio.\n\n\n With this announcement he broke into a fiery rage, yelling and screaming at the guard with such a hellful passion that the guard simply could not move. When the guards saw what was happening and demanded the mad man to stop with no response, the guard hastily declared him an enemy of the state.\n A gun pointed at his head and with a tear in his eye, Antônio looked at the sky one last time and whispered;"

A child of slaves, a near slave in the Northeast, bullied by everyone he ever knew and by sheer force of will he managed to learn how to read and find inspiration in the works of Lenin and learn of another revolution in a far away land, where the people like him eventually cast off their oppressors and made a better life for themselves, and how they were going to make life better for not just themselves, but the whole world. When João learned of this, he took an oath to himself that he would one day bring this great saving light to Belem, and save not only himself but his fellow countrymen as well. When he learned that there was already a party starting up in Brazil he wasted no time in joining, finding solidarity in his comrades as they dutifully prepared for their own Brazilian revolution. Then disaster struck. The great Bolsheviks, the most successful communists to date, the great liberators of the working class, his idols, had failed. Word soon spread of the disaster, and soon it seemed that the great dream was going to fail, for it seemed that the Revolution had been crushed, and that it was all for naught. But João knew better. Knowing his countrymen, knowing the deplorable conditions they lived in, João refused to give up, he refused to let his countrymen falter. João quickly became known for his rousing speeches and incredible organizing skills, and when Brazil became trapped in yet another constitutional crisis and a nation that seemed headed for civil war, João knew what had to be done, and so did his fellow party members. \n\n\nA great revolution began, this time more successful than João could’ve dreamed. Liberating his countrymen, he felt a dream. And when he and his fellow Party Chairmen came to Rio to formalize the first Revolutional State in the New World he felt Euphoric. But all good things must come to an end. Seeing how his party comrades were becoming more and more revisionist and moderate, refusing to see the problems that Brazil was facing, and turning more and more to soft intellectualism instead of directly helping the Brazilian proletariat. However it wasn’t until he saw his 'comrades” having meetings with the North-East Slave owners that he realized that the old Communist Party had lost its goal and vision, and finally realized it was time for it to be put under new management. What he wasn’t expecting was how many of his comrades felt the same way he did. Facing minimal resistance, he simply called a simple hand poll to fire the Chairman of the Party, and another one to put himself on the headmanship. And now? Now it was time to tell the people of Brazil the good news! After taking a moment to realize just how far he had come, João Amazonas smiled at his people and began his speech with a phrase that he had once dreamed of saying…"
