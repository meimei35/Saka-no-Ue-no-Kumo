DEUTSCHE_RATEREPUBLIK_DESC:0 "After the Revolution of 1918 and the following Civil War, Germany was isolated. Many nations refused to interact with Germany and declared Prussia the legitimate German State. Red Germany, however flourished under Liebknecht, and his successor Levi. In the years leading up to 1936, the Reds have made serious progress. They have fixed the economy, built up the Comintern and have strengthened their position in germany. When the depression hit and Russia, France and Britain fought for their lives, Germany was unimpressed. With a loyal Army, support among the people and the desire to re-shape the world, Germany is truly a force to be reckoned with..."

This announcement has shook up the political landscape of Germany, not only is Levi a beloved public figure, but without him, the KPD has a chance to lose the next election. The Politbüro has already announced that a new candidate has been chosen, but an NMAPD or USPD government dosen’t seem this far away anymore..."

germany.2.desc:0 "After the retirement of Levi, the Politbüro has decided to choose Ernst Meyer as new candidate for the Position of chairman of the council of people's commissairies. While he has a very impressive biography and great knowledge in all matters of politics, he lacks charisma and warmth. Thus, the Vanguardist wing of KPD decided to propose their own candidate, the Russian immigrant, Lev Sedov. To stabilize the Party, a proposal was made by a number of influential communists to choose a new candidate to re-unite the Party."

It has been decades has it not? And yet what has occured since, despite our miraculous revolution? What has occured has been a travesty comrades. The job was left half finished! Across the continent, our comrades were butchered by depraved acts of White Terror. The degenerate French ran our good comrades out of the nation and now they sit eagerly on our borders looking to impose their proto-reactionary agenda on us. The British impose the same dictatorial bourgeois hegemony as they always have, keeping down the flames of proletariat revolution. All of this has occurred to the detriment of the great German nation and its socialist people. No more will this travesty be allowed to occur.\"\n\n\"The revisionism has come to an end. In its place, arises the true vanguard of the German workers. The National Majority Workers Party of Germany is here and it will stay here. As the protectorate of the workers and as a protectorate of Germany against the anti-Red reptiles that plague the Earth. The age of half measured socialism is over. In its place, a new socialism takes root. One that will go all the way to free every man woman and child from the yoke of bourgeois hegemony. The plundering of our people is at an end. Now is the time for our Red retribution. And we will make no apologies for our rightful revenge.\""

germany.5.desc:0 "After his rise to power, Comrade Frahm has addressed the public:\n\n\"I can still hear the screams from the trenches. They call out for mercy and for peace. They do not desire war anymore; they want to come home. While my opponents have insisted that the only way we shall survive is to fight, I think differently. There is a path to peace for Germany; through diplomacy and alliances, we can survive and come out stronger for it.\"\n\n\"Futurists, capitalists and reactionaries all think that the only way to solve an issue is violence. Even some socialists think this way. I do not; I have seen what war does to a nation, and it is not pretty. The soldiers agree with me on this, and you do as well; you want peace. So let us have it, at long last!\""
germany.5.a:0 "Long live Chairman Frahm!"
germany.6.t:0 "The Notice"
germany.6.desc:0 "Despite the prestigious honor that comes from winning in an election, the KPD has not scheduled a speech for its candidate. Instead, it has given out a press notice, declaring that a speech will follow later. They have however assured that it will come, promising it to be even better than previous speeches.

germany.7.t:0 "Comrade Sedov's Address"
germany.7.desc:0 "Today, Comrade Sedov has addressed the Public:\n\n\"It has been more than 16 years now since I have been chased from Russia. I have seen the White Terror of Koltchak and his goons as they ripped and tore through that beautiful country. And all for the establishment of a personal dictatorship led by a foolish, stupid man. In a lot of ways, your position is much the same; Austria and Prussia look to carve up our nation into two pieces, and those lunatics in France won’t be content until we are wiped from the map! I will not let this happen, comrades!\"\n\n\"Germany has principles; good principles, of democracy and freedom. That must continue to exist, but it will not exist if we allow ourselves to be conquered. Instead of pacifism or anarchism, I offer a more responsible government, and a renewed armaments program, to ensure that our armies can repel the reactionaries and Futurists which assault us. The party shall not merely be another political organization; it shall be the harbinger of socialism to all of Europe. We shall all be free of tyranny; the Internationale shall unite the human race!\""
germany.7.a:0 "A beautiful speech."
germany.8.t:0 "Comrade Meyer's Speech"
germany.8.desc:0 "Today, Comrade Meyer addressed the Public:\n\n\"Comrade Luxemburg once said that Germany had two options coming out of the war: socialism or barbarism. We could either continue to let things get worse, and be either stuck with a capitalist state or a Futurist dictatorship, or we could pick something different. Something far more humane and democratic than any current system. Today, I stand before you all as that alternative!\"\n\n\"This nation shall never again be subject to the terrors and tyranny of other nations and their decrepit systems of government and economics. We shall shine bright as a model to all the world, and prove that socialism is the future! Barbarism shall never reach our lands, as long as we stand firm and resilient!\""

germany.bavaria.desc:0 "After we now know about the ideas to turn Bavaria against us, we cannot ignore it much longer. We have to act fast, before Bavaria destabilises even further! However, there are two ideas brought forth in the Reichsrätekongress: Comrade Georg Engl wants to appease the Bavarians by giving more power to the Peasant’s Councils and highering the standard of living in the Countryside. Comrade Hermann Gartmann, on the other hand, thinks that we should collectivise the Land and use our VkRSS to solve the situation."

While previous ones discuss domestic policy and the road to power, this one will be mainly focused on Germany’s foreign policy and the way we interact with the world in the years to come. Questions like national self-determination, anti-colonialism, economic relations and even the forming of governments-in-exile will all be put to vote by the congress.\n\nClass warfare cannot merely be a struggle of party against the national bourgeoisie. This next war will be the struggle of a proletarian nation against the international capitalist class and all the influence they have upon the world. In order to break it, every tool in our arsenal must be used, because the capitalists will use every tool in their arsenal as well. Our conflict is just; as Trotsky says, \"A slave-owner who through cunning and violence shackles a slave in chains, and a slave who through cunning or violence breaks the chains – let not the contemptible eunuchs tell us that they are equals before a court of morality!\""
germany.9.a:0 "Let the congress begin!"

germany.10.t:0 "Germany approaches us"
germany.10.desc:0 "Today, the German Ambassador in Bergen has approached our Government and has proposed a united Arctic Naval Expedition, to find new Passages and strengthen the Bond between our Nations. Our Naval Commanders agree that an Expedition would be beneficial for our overall Navy experience and mapping of the north pole is a project worthy of committing too. Some fear, however, that Germanie advances are to draw us into the third International. And then there are some who also think that Germany wants to do that, but think that would be a good thing. What should we do?"
germany.10.a:0 "Yes, expeditions to the North pole would be good, but we don’t need the Germans."
germany.10.b:0 "A great idea! We will sail with our German Comrades!"
germany.10.c:0 "We don't need such projects!"

germany.11.t:0 "The issue of Sexuality"
germany.11.desc:0 "Since the glorious socialist November Revolution, Homo- and Transsexuality and all other forms of sexual expression have been decriminalized and more and more pushed into normality by pioneers such as comrade Magnus Hirschfeldt. However, similar thing could also be observed in multiple centers of futurist Ideology. Fiume has always been openly accepting of homosexuality while French Escadronists and Röhm even promote it within the army. More and more voices have arisen denouncing “sexual depravity” as “root cause for Futurism” and “the deterioration of the German Youth”. Today, the NMAPD-Faction of the Reichsrätekongress has therefore brought in a call for the re-criminalisation of “sexual deviants”. For this Question, Magnus Hirschfeldt has talked in front of the Congress about their mistake to limit the rights of hard-working, proletarian german gays and “third-Genders” while comrade Maslow from the KPD-Faction denounced the NMAPD for “Non-Marxist” thinking due to their beliefs that “Not Class, but sexuality shapes the Ideology of Man” and has also warned the Recriminalisation would disenfranchise Non-Straight Comrades and would push them towards Futurism."
germany.11.a:0 "This degeneracy has to stop! Recriminalize it!"
germany.11.b:0 "We cannot take away rights from so many Proletarians! Just make sure VKRSS suppresses any french influence."
germany.11.c:0 "This is madness! Our Gay Comrades are just as able as any other!"
