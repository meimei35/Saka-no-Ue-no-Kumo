#BOOKMARKS#
UNITED_STATES_DESC:0 "While avoiding the devastation of the world war, the USA political landscape was forever changed following the collapse of the Democrat party due to internal party tensions. This gave the Republican party a decade long control over the government. However due to the Great Depression, Republican rule is threatened. Under the hands of Andrew Mellon, a committed laissez faire economist the depression has only worsened. With the 1936 election encroaching. four major parties compete to see who will gain the presidency and with the oncoming tide of war, the United States will never be the same again."

#LEADER DESCRITIONS#
politics_andrew_mellon_desc:0 "Andrew William Mellon, the 32nd president and currently the most hated person in the United states. Having come to the presidency in 1934, after his predecessor Harry M Daugherty was assassinated following the economic crash. Mellon has prevented all government intervention into the US economy, believing that the best solution to the depression is for the economy to recover by itself and for corporations to the lead in helping the economy recover. This has not happened and two years later the economy has only worsened. While all of this is not his fault, his inaction has caused the situation to worsen. With the Republican party having abandoned him and Impeachment against him being discussed, it is not likely that Andrew Mellon will be president for much longer."

usa.1.t:0 "The 1936 Election"
usa.1.desc:0 "At long last, election day has arrived.\n\nEveryone knows how important this election is. The last two decades have seen a radical change in the international order and the internal situation within the states. Economic mishap, radicalism and extremism on the rise, new developments in weaponry; everything to make the next decade hectic, violent and even apocalyptic. Who America selects to be the president, therefore, is a big deal.\n\nFrom the left, we have Fiorello La Guardia, the current mayor of New York City and proponent of political, economic and social reform, as a candidate from Jobless Progressives. He proposed multiple programs aiming to repair damages of Mellon's presidency and thus, has gathered a lot of working class support, and is seen as serious threats by big business and more authoritarian minded politicians. Then we have Dan Moody, the youngest Governor of Texas ever elected. The candidate of the American Party, Moody has solidified his reputation for his anti-Klan stances, and has promised a reasonable and moderate government. The incumbent Republicans, scrambling after Mellon’s resignation, put forward Bronson M. Cutting as their candidate. A senator for New Mexico, he has championed a platform of freedom of speech and economic reform, and he has been in heavy fighting with Moody over middle class voters. Finally, there is Howard Scott of the Technocrats. An engineer, Scott has proposed radical policies including replacing currency exchange with energy accounting, the creation of a scientific board to oversee the exchange of goods, and the creation of a North American Technate stretching from Alaska and Canada all the way to Venezuela and Columbia. He has been the most popular amongst engineers, scientists and self-styled intellectuals.\n\nThe future of America is now in the hands of the voters. The votes have been counted, and now the President has been decided. The winner is…"
usa.1.c:0 "Fiorello La Guardia! Reform!"
usa.1.a:0 "Bronson M. Cutting! Freedom!"
usa.1.b:0 "Dan Moody! Stability!"

usa.2.t:0 "Ismay Insensé"
usa.2.d:0 "The long awaited english language version of Ismael Insense (original french title Ismay Insensé), the french-made so called Baguette-Western, has finally reached the US. Fast paced action, sexual themes and disturbing levels of violence has made the genre quite popular among the public despite public outcry by both moral guardians and the political left, calling for their banning. The movie is a departure of sorts for the genre as instead of classic wild west setting it features near-future lawless wasteland dominated by futuristic cowboys riding automobiles instead of horses. But the change of setting didn't seem to alienate the audiece as cinema owners are claiming record sales."
usa.2.a:0 "Allow the Movie."
usa.2.b:0 "Ban the Movie."
usa.3.t:0 "History of the United States"
usa.3.d:0 "The Land of the Free avoided most of the chaos and destruction that engulfed the world through WW1. While the USA considered joining the conflict following the sinking of the Lusitania, the fall of France to german forces stopped this in its tracks with popular opinion believing the inevitable german victory was around the corner. This would not come to be, with the UK, Italy and Russia defeating the central powers, with american financial backing supporting their economies and militaries. Their help gave the USA a seat at the peace conference and parts of Woodrow Wilson's fourteen points were implemented.\nWith the success in keeping the USA out of the great war and avoiding devastation, Woodrow Wilson was narrowly elected to a third term, though insiders could tell that the president's health was declining. This would become a disaster in the first month of the presidency where the president collapsed into a coma he would never recover from. With the president incapacitated his vice president William Gibbs McAdoo ran the country from behind the scenes, however this would cause tension to grow within the democrats with figuers led by Oscar Underwood demanding where the president was. This would come to a head in the 1924 democratic primaries where it was leaked that the president had finally died and congressmen led by Oscar Underwood and Dan Moody walked out of the conference out of protest against McAdoo. This would eventually lead to a splinter party called "The American Party" running against the democrats, republicans and new progressive party. This split lead to the republicans winning the election in a landslide. Led by Leonard Wood the Republicans would run the country with near total control with the democrats and americans stealing votes from each other and the progressives being a relatively new party, and as Leonard Wood died, Calvin Coolidge would succeed him.\nHowever the good times could only last so long and the collapse of the British Raj and further problems in the UK caused the stock market to tumble and crash plunging the USA into a depression and Calvin Coolidge too die of a heart attack, leading to his noted laissez faire vice president Andrew Mellon to become president. This also lead to the loss of the Republicans supermajority in the 1934 senate elections, with the progressives, americans and technocrats to gain many seats.\nTwo Years on America has noted recovered from the depression and dissent against the Republican president rises from all sides of the political spectrum. The status quo can only last so long."

usa.4.t:0 "The Santa Clara Flood"
usa.4.d:0 "At 11:58 p.m. on (date), the St. Francis Dam failed catastrophically, sending a 55-foot -high sheet of water cascading down the Santa Clara river valley. Eight different towns are confirmed to have suffered flood damage, with the town of Castaic Junction being completely obliterated. Two Edison company power stations were also destroyed, cutting power to most of Los Angeles and the San Fernando and Santa Clara valleys. Though authorities are not confident the search is over, the preliminary death toll has been set at 385. Governor Upton Sinclair of California has promised an "immediate investigation into this travesty, with absolutely no mercy for those responsible.""
usa.4.a:0 "How could this have happened?"
usa.5.t:0 "J’accuse!"
usa.5.d:0 "The investigation into the Santa Clara Flood has released a shocking preliminary finding, the most recently scheduled repairs were never completed due to President Mellon’s austerity program! Interventionists in Congress are in an uproar, and Governor Sinclair has promised to "take down the irresponsible plutocrat whose callous disregard for national infrastructure cost the lives of hundreds of Californians.""
usa.5.a:0 "How should we handle this, Mr. President?"
usa.6.t:0 "The Impeachment Process Begins"
usa.6.d:0 "The fall of the Santa Clara dam had provided the Progressives and their allies in Congress the perfect opportunity for getting rid of Republican President Andrew Mellon. To politically take the scalp of a US president was too hard to pass up and, with enough numbers do so, they began an impeachment process against the embattled President. With much fanfare being drummed up by Progressive supporters of the impeachment, it seems as though this process could truly bolster the Progressives and other anti-Mellon factions in Congress. Whether President Mellon can whether this political storm or not remains to be seen. What is well known though throughout the nation, is that President Mellon has been backed into a corner. The chances of him being able to fight his way out grow slimmer by the day. The real question is this the end of Andrew Mellons presidency?"
usa.6.a:0 "It is and Andrew Mellon Resings"
usa.6.b:0 "Mellon fights on and defeats the impeachment attempt."

usa.7.t:0 "President Mellon Resigns"
usa.7.d:0 "With the pressure of the impeachment heaping and the knowledge that dragging the Grand Old Party through the dirt and grit of the process would mean unforeseeable damage to the party, President Mellon has announced that he has resigned from the presidency with his Vice President Charles G Dawes taking over effective immediately. Mellon clearly could not count on his whips or even his own party to see him through the process and stop the impeachment. The Progressives and other anti-Mellon forces in Congress have celebrated this announcement, seeing it as a clear political victory. Whether President Dawes can see the Republican Party through the wreckage remains to be seen. For now, he must correct the mistakes of his predecessor to see any chance at re-election."
usa.7.a:0 "So long President Mellon, we hardly knew you."

usa.8.t:0 "The Impeachment Stopped"
usa.8.d:0 "Some questioned the resolve of President Mellon, whether he was politically savvy and capable enough to see through the direct challenge of an impeachment process. He has however, proven them all wrong. Using the power of his whips to brutally put the full force of the Congressional Republican Party to action against the impeachment process, President Mellon has survived the onslaught of his attempted impeachment. This is a clear victory for the President and has no doubt bolstered his once ebbing power. The worst it seems is over for President Mellon and, as they say, business can continue as usual."
usa.8.a:0 "Through pure political willpower, President Mellon survives to see another day!"

usa.9.t:0 "Picking the Vice Presidential Candidate"
usa.9.d:0 "As the election day draws nearer, the parties are searching far and wide for people to fill the cabinet of this new presidency. The vice presidency, once dismissed by John Nance Garner as "not being worth a warm bucket of piss", does have a role to play. They can give advice to the president, and can act as both President of the Senate and tiebreaker (not to mention the fact that they step in in case of the death of the President). Jobless Progressive candidate James Renshaw Cox has two main candidates in mind for the position. \nFirst off is Fiorello H. La Guardia. A charismatic politician, his time as Mayor of New York City saw the unifying of the transit system, saw the building of low income housing, playgrounds, parks and even airports, and restored faith in the police and the city government. He is considered authoritarian by his detractors for his domineering style of leadership, but his supporters argue that this is merely proof of his ability to pass pragmatic and moral legislation. The other candidate is Elizabeth Gurley Flynn. A founding member of the American Civil Liberties Union, she has been a strong advocate for freedom of speech, labor rights, women’s rights (including birth control) and even socialism. Her radical proposals for a "commonwealth of labor" based on republican and anarcho-syndicalist proposals worry the moderates of the party, but no one can deny her commitment to her ideals or her charisma.\nNeedless to say, this could represent a major turn in the Jobless Progressives. It could remain a moderate social democratic party, with Fiorello championing social reform and a more responsible federal government. Or, with Flynn, it could become a socialist party, with a strong focus on free speech and labor issues and an axe to grind with the state. At the end of the day, the choice is up to Cox. "
usa.9.a:0 "La Guardia shall be the Vice President! Reform is the order of the day!"
usa.9.b:0 "Flynn shall be the Vice President! Liberty shall never perish from this earth!"

usa.10.t:0 "The Death of James Renshaw Cox"
usa.10.d:0 "The nation is in mourning; the president is dead.\n\The dust bowl was devastating to the people of the midwest. Crops died, water dried up and the climate was harsher than ever. Many chose to leave rather than suffer there, and California saw a mass influx of refugees. Problem is, they weren’t much better off; economic misfortune still ruled those streets as well. And so, the refugees banded togetheir, and formed communities wherever they could. Cox, as both a publicity stunt and out of genuine concern, visited one of these communities in Fresno to hear their concerns and feelings. Things went well at first; Cox was silent and respectful as the people their poured their hearts out about the horrors they had experienced. He promised economic reform and better protection against the climate, and was met with applause. Cox was walking through the crowds, shaking hands and hugging people as he went.\n\Then a shot rang out. Cox collapsed to the ground, and people started screaming. Two men, clad in black robes and hoods and brandishing weapons, started to yell. They called him a dirty Marxist-Councilist-Bolshevik-Anarchist, and a race traitor along with that. The police quickly took advantage of the situation and arrested the two men, but the damage had been done. The champion of the poor and oppressed of America lay dead in the streets. His followers knew that God would save his soul, for he was just. But would God save theirs?"
usa.10.a:0 "My God! How awful."

usa.11.t:0 "The Funeral of James Renshaw Cox"
usa.11.d:0 "The room fell silent as the speaker walked to the podium. Before, people chatted about the loss of their president, their friend. Some cried, overwhelmed by the terror of the whole thing. But not the speaker. Former governor Gifford Pinchot had backed Cox during his early days, seeing his bid for the presidency as being uniquely progressive and reformist in nature. It was tough seeing him go. "Cox didn’t just see America. He felt every part of it; he made it is goal to understand the worries and trouble of every single person in this country. And he worked so hard to make sure that these worries would disappear, because that was necessary for a free society. This is why the Legion killed them; they don’t want America to rise forth and be what it can be. They want America to merely remain white, or protestant, or whatever they think America is. Cox showed another way." Pinchot’s comments have been criticized as being "overtly political", but he defended himself saying that "it’s the president’s funeral. He wouldn’t have had it anyway". Regardless, America has a new president again, and once more, the balance of power has changed. "
usa.11.a:0 "Why couldn’t it have been a normal election?!"

usa.12.t:0 "La Guardia is Sworn in as President"

When she arrived back at Washington, D.C, she declared to the crowd that Cox’s mission of an America governed by labor and toil would come true no matter what, and that even the mortal coil would not stop Cox’s objective. After that, the official swearing in procedure had to be held; a judge was found, along with a copy of the bible and a hardcover version of the Declaration of Independence. Flynn snuck in a copy of the IWW Constitution into the bible while no one was looking, and took her position. As the judge read his statement, the words of Joe Hill resonated in her head."

Anxiously he turned on the car, \"What are you doing?!\" the man in the back said, \"Moving us further back, they can see us here before they pass by.\" Nick had been sitting in the smoletring car for too long to be the reason that the operation failed. He reversed the car back a couple meters further behind the mass of bricks and dusty blanks. As he heard their car slowly getting closer to them he turned the car on once again.\nThe Crime couple zoomed past the rubble like a racer, completely oblivious to the cop car that soon was on their tail. as they raced through the barren desert it was clear that Bonnie and Clyde had the high ground, they were speeding probably double as fast as the cop car, even breaking to almost a near halt only to speed away as soon as Nick got close enough. However as they broke again to toy with their unwanted companion a coyote ran onto the road and went right under the wheel of the car, the sudden bump from the poor creature along with their front wheels sliding forward was enough for the car to start wheering. As Clyde desperately turned the steering wheel left and right the car only became more chaotic in its motion, soon after the car flew off the road, rolling into the sand top-down.

Ruthless, cunning and efficient, he had been able to eliminate anyone and everyone who has tried to take him down, and yet has been able to always stay one step ahead of the law, dodging and weaving through investigations into his life and his exact activities. The general public used to see him as a modern day Robin Hood, who donated his money to charities and the poor, and used his strength to defend the innocent. The St. Valentine’s Day Massacre changed all that, however, leaving seven people dead and the public angered. And now, he has been cornered. His hideout in Wisconsin, a modest home belonging to some friends of the family, has been discovered thanks to some helpful locals filling the agents in on his day to day habits and schedule. Its likely to have at least some security, but the building itself is certainly not built for defense. The G-Men have the advantage in this case. Al Capone will not walk away from this house a free man; that is certain. The question, however, is what to do with him. Many in the bureau want him brought into custody; he may be a bastard, but he could possibly have information on the activities of other gangs that could be useful. Others are skeptical; they think that it may be better to just shoot him dead in order to scare off criminals thinking that crime pays. The choice is yours at the end of the day. "

When Agent Nixon spotted Capone running away from the building, dressed only in his pajamas, he opened fire, and in a matter of moments, the king of crime was dead. The public has not responded well to this. Although Al Capone is widely hated after the St. Valentine’s Day Massacre, the killing of an unarmed man is something many feel uncomfortable with. Some public officials from the Jobless Progressives have even called for an investigation into the operation. When questioned about the entire affair, Richard Nixon responded calmly. "I welcome this sort of investigation,'' he said. "People gotta know, whether the men assigned with carrying out the law are crooks. Well, I am not a crook."

When interviewed about that affair, Nixon said that he was humbled by the support he has seen, and that he was grateful to be seen as a saviour of sorts. "The greatest honor history can bestow is the title of peacemaker," he said. "And to receive that from the people of this great nation is very kind."

It only got worse when Nixon was interviewed about the affair; he said that "a criminal is a criminal; if he gets shot, it's too damn bad." Needless to say, this did not exactly sway public opinion to his side. Quite the opposite: public pressure on the FBI only got worse from there.

However, Progressives and Republicans argue that the notion would put the nation closer to a civil war that would lead to a huge amount of casualties and even start a wave of Marxist terrorism in America, one that could even get the attenion of Germany.  As such, Progressive senators propose the alternative; provide some arms and money to the rebels just enough to cause some instability but not big enough to start a civil war, meaning the number of casualties will be lower but could still risk stagnation in progress.

This day was no exception: after our leader himself announced that this cartoon would concern matters of national importance, even adults found themselves flocking to see the film. Before an audience of starry-eyed children and concerned parents, the cartoon began.\nA title card appeared, titled \"How to Be a Good American\", accompanied by jolly orchestral music. The scene then showed the mischievous Pete pacing around, clearly up to no good. He then was shown sneaking into Mickey’s factory, which the mouse had bought in previous episodes, and talking to the workers inside. Pete began furiously shouting gibberish at them, which made the workers grow increasingly irate and riotous, and Pete encouraged them to go after their boss. At this point, several left-wing individuals in the crowd began to boo, but were immediately silenced by the enraptured crowd.\nPete soon led the crowd of angry workers throughout the building, smashing machines and robbing safes. At this point, the scene cut to Mickey, sleeping in his chair. A young girl was by him, clearly his secretary (as well as a stand-in for the children in the audience), when she noticed the commotion in the factory. She ran down, only to be greeted by Pete and the protesting workers. Pete tried to convince her to join them, but with her patriotic loyalty in full swing, she instead ran back upstairs to warn Mickey. Pete and his followers tried to intercept her, but were blocked by various cartoon obstacles and booby traps.\nThe girl ran into the office and woke up Mickey, warning him of the impending danger. Mickey immediately sat up and dialed his friends Goofy and Donald Duck to assist in warding off the protesters. As Pete and the workers finally approached Mickey’s office, clearly scuffed from the boss's defenses, they were met at the door by Mickey, who chased them off with his cartoony pistol. They tried to run out the door, but were greeted by Goofy and Donald, who were dressed in paramilitary uniforms and armed to the teeth. This descended into cartoon violence, in which Mickey and his friends beat Pete and the workers to a pulp. The children laughed at the scene, while the adults were far more uncomfortable, but didn’t dare show it.\nThe film ended with the workers returning to their jobs, while Mickey gave a special medal to the young girl.

Then, all Hell broke loose.\nIn universities and laboratories, people cheered and kissed, ecstatic for their new supremacy over the landmass. In churches and cooperatives, people weeped, knowing their time was at an end. The victorious American soldiers and their native collaborators partied and revelled, while the last resistance cells fell to pits of despair and suicide.\nFor the vast majority of people, however, there was simply a sensation of deep strangeness to the matter. Ever since its settlement by natives thousands of years ago, the continent had been a divided land, only united in its shared animosity towards the European imperialists (and still, Canada often refrained from this hatred). Now, with the continent unified under the unprecedented behemoth of technocracy, nobody quite knew what to make of the matter. It was like witnessing an act of God, suddenly and finally uprooting the entire cosmos. Now, the various races of Yankee and Negro and Quebecois and Mexican now became one: North American.

The entire thing felt rather Kafkaesque.\nIndeed, amongst the military parade and streams of propaganda, a new race of Americans emerged. This occurred not in the way the Technocrats wanted to, with every person throwing aside their prejudices in favor of glorious Technocracy. Instead, there was a universal feeling, unrestrained by old borders and ethnicities, that reigned over the people. They knew that they now lived under an unstoppable power, which governed for the sake of utilitarian growth, without any regard for faith or morality or beauty.

While the current efforts of our leader, Marcus Garvey, has been commendable, we are facing a shortage of support in our crusade, especially in the economic field and arms. In an unexpected turn of events, President Moody of the American nation has approved the unconditional assistance to our glorious Liberia. They will help out in giving us the money needed to sustain the infrastructure and development of our nation and its citizens, as well as providing some of their guns and other military equipment to us in order to get a fighting chance against our barbaric opponents. Nonetheless, white critics  as well some of the most skeptical members of our nation argue that the notion would provoke tensions between neighboring colonial powers and would warrant some consequences among us. Nonetheless, President Moody hopes that the support will be enough to sustain our nation against any threat. We can only hope he remains true to his word and will continue to be beneficial to the Liberian nation in the long-run."

Thought unlikely and utopian by liberals and Leninists alike, we have proven them all wrong. We can ensure that this nation becomes the land of the oppressed it was always meant to be! Come on, come all, from whatever background, faith, creed or person you may be, to the American Republic of Labor!"

USA_community_militas_desc:0 "What is the army, other than a tool for the capitalist class and a sectarian clique of madmen who believe that they know how to best defend the country? The new socialist army shall be made up of the people themselves! Militias shall be trained and formed within communities, and the comradeship they build will strengthen their bonds with their neighbors and produce better fighters as a result. Just as the revolutionaries of 76 did, we shall have no need for standing armies!"
USA_jury_justice:0 "Jury Justice"
USA_jury_justice_desc:0 "The justice system should be built on responsibility, justice and rehabilitation. Juries should have more power over the process than justices, as a jury of one’s peers is often far fairer than some established country lawyer.

USA_community_help_schemes:0 "Community Help Schemes"
USA_community_help_schemes_desc:0 "In order to build a greater sense of community amongst the American people, we should begin to promote help schemes.

USA_investigate_corruption:0 "Investigation into Corruption"
USA_investigate_corruption_desc:0 "Sadly, many members of the government, in both local and federal levels, are less interested in protecting the people and care more for their own personal gain.

USA_anti_lynching_bill_liberal:0 "Pass the Anti Lynching Bill"
USA_anti_lynching_bill_liberal_desc:0 "The fact that anyone can just murder one of their fellow citizens and face no kind of legal reprucussion is immoral and downright criminal.

USA_set_up_job_centres_desc:0 "The unemployment rate is still much higher than it should ever be. The effects of the stock market crash are still hurting this country, and that needs to change.

USA_coolidges_way:0 "Coolidges Way"
USA_coolidges_way_desc:0 "Although he may be gone, Calvin Coolidge is still blamed for the woes this country has faced. This is incorrect: he did so much for this country and never asked for anything in return.

USA_scale_back_reforms:0 "Scale Back Reforms"
USA_scale_back_reforms_desc:0 "While the economic reforms and government support may have been necessary at one point, they aren’t really needed anymore.

USA_restrain_federal_reserve:0 "Restrain the Federal Reserve"
USA_restrain_federal_reserve_desc:0 "As we have said before, government regulations are often more of a hindrance than a helper.

Let us end their tyranny, and restrict their powers and abilities over the American people and their wallet."
USA_balanced_budget:0 "Balanced Budget"
USA_balanced_budget_desc:0 "A balanced budget will guarantee economic stability and maximum freedom for the American people in these times.

USA_the_new_way:0 "The New Way"
USA_the_new_way_desc:0 "Those who sing the praises of laissez-faire are the reason we are in this mess!

USA_enact_minimum_wage:0 "Enact Minimum Wage"
USA_enact_minimum_wage_desc:0 "No one should be paid at rates so low that they can’t afford anything. Considering how hard the average American worker, well, works, this should be criminal.

USA_true_technocratic_society:0 "True Technocratic Society"
USA_true_technocratic_society_desc:0 "With the government, broader society and the grand majority of people all working as is required of them, the vision the founders of the technocracy movement has, at no small amount of struggle and hardship, come to absolute fruition. But there is always more we can do, perfection can always be closer. Onwards!"

USA_technocracy_phillipines:0 "Install Technocracy in the Phillipines"
USA_technocracy_phillipines_desc:0 "The Philippines is another poor victim of bourgeoise imperialism. However, if we released them politically, it would create mass chaos and Marxist revolution in the country. We must do our best to erase the past bonds of imperialism while showing the Filipino people the most rational and obvious method to govern their society-technocracy."
USA_domino_theory:0 "Domino Theory"
USA_domino_theory_desc:0 "Like a line of dominos falling one after another, we can set in motion a chain of events to set up technocratic governments in other countries near and far. By funding technocracy movements in other nations and providing volunteers, arms and advisors, we can ensure that a technocratic world will be a very real possibility for the future."
USA_american_ambitions:0 "American Ambitions"
USA_american_ambitions_desc:0 "The UTA has proven to be a rousing success, but we cannot rest on our laurels for long. Further action is needed to bring the light of technocracy to our neighbors, and we must not be afraid of dragging the reactionaries and liberals alike kicking and screaming into the fold. Like a parent punishing a misbehaving child, it is for their own good, regardless of how painful it may be."
USA_central_american_coups:0 "Central American Coups"
USA_central_american_coups_desc:0 "To make way for the North American Technate, the democratically elected but mostly uncooperative heads of states in Central America must be replaced with military dictators favorable to Technocratic interests."
USA_work_with_peru:0 "Work with Peru"
USA_work_with_peru_desc:0 "The National rejuvenation movement in Peru, or Tawantisuyu as they prefer to be called nowadays has proven a success in modernising and uplifting their country. As fellow accelerationists, we will extend a helping hand to them to help install a technocratic economy, so they can share in the same benefits as us."
USA_support_quebec:0 "Support Quebec"
USA_support_quebec_desc:0 "The Quebecois have always in some form or another sought autonomy and independence from their Canadian overlords, and as the saying goes, a house divided against itself cannot stand. With these pieces of information in mind, we can fund, arm and train Quebecois separatists while also educating them in our ways."
USA_terror_attacks_canada:0 "Terror Attacks in Canada"
USA_terror_attacks_canada_desc:0 "With the seperatist movement under our wise guidance, they can begin their efforts in earnest. Covert attacks on public figures, bombings, shootings, assassinations and guerilla warfare will plague Canada from end to end. We will ensure the rebels will have all the guns, bombs and funding they will need to raise hell."
USA_great_north_american_war:0 "Great North American War"
USA_great_north_american_war_desc:0 "With Canada hamstrung by terror attacks and Mexico already an inferior neighbor, the stage is set for our main two opponents in North America to be annexed by force. There can be no diplomacy, we will bring the light of technocracy to the continent with terrible swiftness, those who resist will be swept aside. The old order will not give up easily, but in the end, we will give them no choice."
USA_form_the_NAT:0 "Form the North American Technate"
USA_form_the_NAT_desc:0 "From Anchorage to Panama City, the system of Technocracy is dominant. It is time."
USA_destroy_second_phillipines_insurrection:0 "Destroy the Second Phillipines Insurrection"
USA_destroy_second_phillipines_insurrection_desc:0 "The puppet government we put in place in the Philippines has fallen alarmingly quickly, the previous authoritarian government has reasserted power to put down a liberal insurrection which quickly gained a great deal more members, even some military units have joined their cause. We must act quickly and decisively to end this crisis before it spirals entirely out of control."
USA_fortress_guam:0 "Fortress Guam"
USA_fortress_guam_desc:0 "Guam is our Pacific frontier, and our outermost territory which will be invaluable at launching and supporting our campaigns in the region, but being a relatively small area, it is potentially vulnerable to invasion which would leave us flat footed. To prevent this, a layered network of defences including coastal guns, outwards facing bunkers and naval minefields to ensure our pacific springboard is kept safe."
USA_take_over_indochina:0 "Take Over Indochina"
USA_take_over_indochina_desc:0 "Indochina is a region of particular interest with it's vast resources, both in raw materials and manpower, and it's strategic position against the monstrous imperialist beast of Nippon. We should be prepared to take control of this part of the world in the coming future."
USA_prepare_for_australian_invasion:0 "Prepare for Australian Invasion"
USA_prepare_for_australian_invasion_desc:0 "Australia is a prime target for the next stage of International technocracy, their people yearn to be free from the old ways and we will share with them the glory of technocracy. Though their government will not come to heel without a fight, we must prepare for this reality. By building up infrastructure in critical areas, the invasion will be carried out much smoother."
USA_war_plan_scarlet:0 "War Plan Scarlet"
USA_war_plan_scarlet_desc:0 "With the infrastructure, troops and materials in place, the Australian region can be brought under our control so that a favourable government can be placed. Technocracy will suit the government and people well, the whole area is a sad waste of potential and racial issues which our system is fully equipped to not only solve, but turn into new strengths. Subsume them!"

USA_take_over_the_yangtze_desc:0 "China is a mess of warlords on every street corner pretending to be the legitimate government to the entire Chinese homeland. We can take it upon ourselves to remedy this unfortunate situation with force of arms, by taking over the states along the Yangtze  and introducing technocratic governments to them, then the issue of a dozen semi-legitimate scrapping warlords can be brought to a fast end."
USA_combat_japan:0 "Combat Japan"
USA_combat_japan_desc:0 "Japanese imperialism is a threat to our own ambitions as well. They must be cornered and countered by America, their natural opposite in mindset and values."
USA_pacific_hegemony:0 "Pacific Hegemony"
USA_pacific_hegemony_desc:0 "The pacific is, without a shadow of a doubt, under our dominion. Technocracy has not only bettered the lives of everyone in North America, but is set to do so in Asia and Australasia. But this is not the end of our ambitions, the dream of world technocracy has become a very real possibility, and with the Pacific entrenched, the world is our oyster."
