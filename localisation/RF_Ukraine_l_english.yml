UKR_DESC_MENU:0 "A free nation, Ukraine is one of the great beacons of the Intermarium and one of it's breadbaskets as the nation is a world-renowned developing democracy, which has a strong welfare state and generally a growing economy. But many elements within the country despise the corruption within the Parliament and suggest that there are German collaborationists all across the country and that a military Junta is needed to be enacted to secure Ukraine's freedom. But another group is brewing across Ukraine, the Accelerationist coalition - who shall win the great battle for the future of the nation?"

ukraine_mikhnovsky_scandal:0 "Mikhnovsky's scandal"
ukraine_mikhnovsky_scandal_desc:0 "Mykola Mikhnovsky used to be a great statesman. He was one of those people who supported Ukrainian independence and irredentism before it became mainstream. His pamphlet 'Independent Ukraine' became an undisputed bestseller both among the Left and among the Right. However, the Great War and humiliation caused by loss of Left-bank Ukraine broke him, and now Mikhnovsky is little more than a buffoon, re-elected simply due to his past deeds. Today however, he became an embarrassment, when he ranted from the podium about imminent doom and that half of the parliament are closet German agents. What shall be done now?"
ukraine_information_fake:0 "Democracy Must Continue"
ukraine_information_fake_desc:0 "Obviously, what Mikhnovsky said is...not even a lie, it’s simply nonsense and slander. Our democracy is as healthy as it can get, but now thanks to one jingoistic clown we’re having a vote of no confidence against USDRP government. Some may say that this is beginning of a crisis. Meanwhile, UDKhP member of parliament Fedir Lyzohub said that we may have escaped an even more dire situation."
ukraine_snap_election:0 "1936 Snap Elections"
ukraine_snap_election_desc:0 "When secret police didn’t reveal anything suspicious replying to Mikhnovsky’s request, but Petliura still insisted on carrying out elections 'for the sake of our democracy', the parliament had to agree. After all, the competition has started already, and it is likely that new Rada will be different from the previous."
ukraine_socialist_victory:0 "UPSR Revisionist Socialist Victory"
ukraine_socialist_victory_desc:0 "Mykhailo Hrushevsky and his sworn comrades of Ukrainian Party of Socialist Revolutionaries have finally achieved plurality of seats in Rada. While the government is being swiftly taken over by UPSR ministers, Hrushevsky has defeated his opponents and is going to be inaugurated as a second president of Ukraine. Both Intermarium and Internationale are waiting, because Hrushevsky’s views seem to be strangely alike with those held both in Poland and Germany, and public at home too waits reforms, but let our new President - and the author of bestseller history books - speak on this matter on his own."
ukraine_rapid_land_reform:0 "Rapid Land Reform"
ukraine_rapid_land_reform_desc:0 "Peasants, rejoice! No longer will your kid ask you at the evening: 'Dad, when we will get our soil?'! For after passing this law, every peasant family will get a share of remaining landowners’ land, and it will be fully paid by the state, no peasant contribution needed! This land will be your private possession, obviously, but if you wish to contribute to our Revolution, then voluntary cooperation between independent farmers is always an option."
ukraine_calm_elites:0 "Calm the Elites"
ukraine_calm_elites_desc:0 "What we need to explain to the high society that provides most of financing to our rival parties, and that instinctively fears the words 'socialist' and 'councilist', is that we are not Communists, and our Socialism doesn’t involve total seizure of assets by the state. Our Socialism is first of all for the Peasants, and it’s not a 'Dictatorship of the Proletariat'."
ukraine_slow_industrialization:0 "Slow Industrialization"
ukraine_slow_industrialization_desc:0 "While it is no doubt that Right-bank Ukraine is industrially less developed than Halychyna or Left-bank Ukraine, it would be harmful to our society to pursue the industrialization at all costs. More so, to industrialize quicker we would need either a helping hand of bourgeoisie - and that would compromise our socialistic ideals, or a nearly total state control - and that would make us look like the very “Red Menace” everyone talks now about."
ukraine_market_socialism:0 "Market Socialism"
ukraine_market_socialism_desc:0 "Who said that Socialism automatically means planned allocation of resources? Even we, arguably the most far-left faction in the Parliament, have nothing against market - after all, it used to be a part of our culture for many centuries, and market’s existence doesn’t contradict the expansion of socialist forms of ownership. Which is why our Socialism is Market Socialism. "
ukraine_table_partisans:0 "Round-Table with Partisans"
ukraine_table_partisans_desc:0 "We may not be able to assert military control over temporarily occupied lands on the Left bank of Dnipro on our own, but fortunately, there is a tool just for that - partisans, various anarchists and nationalists loosely unified around figure of Nestor Makhno, who used to be a die-hard anarchist but by now has reconciled with us. We shall host a secret conference of partisan leaders, where a plan of “New Russia’s” downfall will be crafted."
ukraine_artist_apolitical:0 "Make our Artistic Renaissance Apolitical"
ukraine_artist_apolitical_desc:0 "The biggest problem about our various Modernists, Futurists, Cubists, Surrealists and other -ists is that while they are brilliant artists, writers and poets, they’re also a bit too much individualistic, and have unfortunate infatuation with France - a counterrevolutionary, oppressive country. While we are not Communists to conduct purges, we can urge our artists to retire from politics, perhaps by incorporating their work to our own propaganda."
ukraine_slightly_red:0 "A Slightly Red Ukraine"
ukraine_slightly_red_desc:0 "With our socialistic transformation underway, Land Reform swiftly completed, the Rich slowly integrated into our Socialist society as it should be, and cause of social liberation expected to be expanded to other lands inhabited by Ukrainians, we can say for sure that Ukraine that was - a capitalistic, bourgeois republic -, and a Ukraine we are ruling over right now - a land of socialism, a republic of labouring masses - are two different realities. Perhaps, our opponents calling us “Reds” may be right after all…"
ukraine_liberal_victory:0 "UNDO-UPSF Liberal Coalition"
ukraine_liberal_victory_desc:0 "Triumph of freedom! Ukrainian people have elected a new, Liberal coalition to rule the government. With Liberal plurality in the parliament, and the President expected to be either Dmytro Doroshenko, known diplomat, historian and leader of Ukrainian Party of Socialists-Federalists, or Yevhen Petrushevych, well-mannered gentleman from Polish-controlled but Ukrainian-populated lands, the future of Ukraine is certain to be vibrant and a bit unpredictable."
ukraine_economic_freedom:0 "UNDO: Economic Freedom"
ukraine_economic_freedom_desc:0 "Ukrainian National-Democratic Alliance, known also as 'Ob’yednannya' is a Market Liberal party, whose leader Yevhen Petrushevych was chosen by coalition agreement as the next president of Ukraine. Investors are already looking at our country with much less suspicion than before, and liberation of market from the state’s paws is expected to come any day now, but certain circles in Poland have expressed doubt in Petrushevych’s bias in diplomacy. Nonetheless, Ukraine is expected to become a land of economic freedom."
ukraine_human_rights:0 "UPSF: Human Rights"
ukraine_human_rights_desc:0 "Ukrainian Party of Socialists-Federalists, while bearing 'Socialist' in its name, is actually just Social Liberal, and 'Federalist' comes from the time when this party existed semi-legally during the last days of Russian Imperial rule in Right-bank Ukraine. The party, led by newly inaugurated president Dmytro Doroshenko, states that further centralization, fight against corruption and protection of human rights shall be the keystone of Ukrainian politics for the next seven years, earning approval from nations such as Italy, Britain and USA."
ukraine_free_market:0 "Implement the Free Market"
ukraine_free_market_desc:0 "When our country achieved independence, its Social-Democratic leadership was still partially under a Marxist illusion that capital is a force of evil. While they didn’t deny the usefulness of market economy, they imposed on it too many restrictions, that didn’t help a bit and only led to rampant corruption and cronyism in border guards and customs’ service. We shall make the businesses in Ukraine more free to breathe, and what will follow is most certainly an economic boom, a thing achievable only if we provide the freedom our petty bourgeoisie so craves for."
ukraine_promise_autonomy:0 "Promise Ashkenazim Autonomy"
ukraine_promise_autonomy_desc:0 "Ukraine is a country of Ukrainians, but it has quite a few minorities as well. Granted our current location and unfortunately small span of the country, our largest minority is not Russians, not Polish and not even Moldovan people. Our largest, arguably the most useful, and undeniably heavily discriminated against minority is the Jews. And, while we could limit our help to them by simply cracking down on discrimination, we could borrow a useful thought or two from the Austromarxists and grant the Ashkenazi populace a kind of 'National-Personal Autonomy' - all Jews could join a non-governmental organization tasked with providing education in Yiddish and defending the civil rights of Jewish minority, and perhaps this organization could even delegate a nonpartisan minister to the government."
ukraine_customs_union:0 "Free Customs Union within Intermarium"
ukraine_customs_union_desc:0 "Liberal ideals of Free Trade is one thing, but being unable to implement them even with your closest allies is another!

ukraine.1.t:0 "Madman’s Rant"
ukraine.1.desc:0 "When it seemed that the day in the parliament won’t get any worse, it was spotted that an MP from a fairly minor centre-right party was going to the podium. It took several seconds for the audience to process that this MP was Mykola Mikhnovsky himself. Some yawned, others prepared to listen, knowing that what will follow won’t be constituted of anything except bullshit. Or so it usually appeared. Mikhnovsky took the position at the podium, overseeing the halls of Central Rada. So majestic, even if rather small, this house provided such a picture of democracy’s infallibility...such an illusion of it.\n-Dear citizens of Ukraine, dear men and women, dear cossacks, and undear scum that are elected to this very council by the people you fool! - Mikhnovsky began his speech, took a cup of water, and continued:\n-When I look at these halls, I always adore - well, “adore” - how utterly pompous and majestic our parliamentarians always behave, and how truly unyielding our democracy looks...at a first glance. In truth, however, - you all know! - that this is a lie. And yes, journalists, write it down, the masses need to know the truth. It is a lie - that nothing threatens our democracy! I can say for sure - three quarters of present here deputies are corrupted, at least a third of those corrupted are involved in voting fraud, - for there’s no other reason for those three people over there in UPSR sector to be re-elected, everyone knows the peasants’ opinion on that party in the region! And what, you might ask, is everything I told, for that is all old news - both to you and to the public. But let me say it... I don’t care if it’s going to kill me... What I definitely know, is that half of the parliament is working for Germans! YES! Half of you bastards are working as shills for disgusting krauts in Berlin, you have sold your Fatherland for a piece of bratwurst, just because your VKSSS puppet masters tell ya! I don’t care whether you laugh at me right now, for I know that what you truly abhor - for you fear the truth, the truth just right now revealed!\nWhen deputy Mykola Mikhnovsky later got into a much more rambling, and progressively more and more incomprehensible ranting, group of MPs urged him to get down and back to his seat, which Mykola reluctantly agreed after two notebooks and a tomato thrown at him. When normal proceedings resumed, some deputies did look quizzically at Mikhnovsky, but that wasn’t something odd - dude had already established his reputation as a jingoistic clown. Anyway, newspapers were expected to publish this story, and some MPs did get uneasy during the speech, one of them saying that perhaps a snap election year ahead the schedule would increase the people’s confidence in democracy. As the break between meetings was announced, MPs and journalists alike went to the parliamentary cafeteria. Of them, two people separated from the main group. One said to other…"

Weird, this situation was. Private plane from Kaunas, with two engines and enough space to fit in thirty passengers, although only ten were on board. “Four Baltic Germans from Riga, three Lithuanians, two Prussians and a Dutchman? All boarding a private plane belonging to a Prussian nobleman, with this as cargo?!” - said Kost’ in French to one of passengers, who appeared to be some sort of informal leader to three or four other passengers...with disturbingly un-civilian manners. Meanwhile, Tymish went to another group of border guards, who were inspecting the cargo. He walked to one of the boxes which the plane was transporting - nothing suspicious, at a first glance. Having nothing to do, as no passenger was really that suspicious, Tymish kicked the box slightly with his boot. A metal cling. \nAlerted by this, the officer took out a knife and cracked the box open. What was inside shouldn’t have been on a cargo of a normal civilian plane. \nNoticing this, one of the passengers softly walked up to Tymish’s back and touched the border guard...with a concealed revolver.

ukraine.3.desc:0 "“Alright lads, everyone knows now that these rodents in the government are traitors. Which means, ladies and gentlemen - we march! We shall show those idiots what a true Ukrainian is made of!”\nSuch words were said at the opening of “Ukrainian Artistic Conference” by Mykhail’ Semenko, who negotiated it with Bolbochan and Bolbochan’s henchmen in Kyiv city duma. Said conference was actually less of an artistic event and more of a political rally, since besides the many futurists and modernists, including rather famous and talented artists, here were present leaders of various paramilitaries, as well as the paramilitaries themselves. In fact, granted how the event was held right on Dumska square, and that most of the present here carried weapons with them, some not even hiding it, the only thing worth waiting for was Bolbochan’s letter.\nAnd here it was. Oh, how wonderful this news was to Accelerationist leaders right now! \nIn a matter of minutes, improvised festival-slash-meeting was reorganized into battle columns. Young people from all un-occupied regions of Ukraine, - and rather old people as well, here and there, - some carrying flags, some with slogan-adorned banners, some with rifles, pistols or even swords, both in military uniforms and civilian clothes, traditional rural and fashionable urban - all sorts of people were here, supporters of change, supporters of something that among the establishment only Bolbochan and like-minded people didn’t found offensive.\n“First Squad, MARCH!”\nThe march began. And in less than an hour, when the vanguard of demonstrants has reached Central Rada, shouting anti-Petliura slogans, the march turned into an improvised siege. \nWhen the guardsman tried to block the way, he was threatened with bayonets and almost ran over by the crowd, but somehow he survived, and a few minutes later joined the protestors himself. Doors of the Parliament were rattled with bullets until a girl from the crowd threw a hand grenade at them, cracking them open. Shocked personnel didn’t even resist as the fierce Accelerationist youth charged into the parliamentary halls, shouting the war cry upheld by modern Free Cossacks:"

Three more carefully placed shots, and boom barrier fell to the ground, letting the trucks with few German agents and their Ukrainian accomplices drive through right into the heart of government’s district at Volodymyrska street. \nTwo hours later, the group was already not just inside the parliamentary building - two dozen guards were killed, and the last defenders of bourgeois Ukrainian parliament have gathered at the rooftop for their last stand. It seemed that victory of the forces of historical materialism was near, and soon a puppet...ahem, friendly councilist government would be proclaimed to the sleepy proletariat of Ukraine’s capital as a new administration of Ukrainian Socialist Republic, but...wait, here they are - Ukrainian troops, armed and ready, dozens, hundreds, no - a few thousands of them, all apparently informed about attempted coup. When artillery pieces and tanks were arranged in a circle around Rada building, and hundreds of rifles pointed at all windows and doors, it became apparent that the Luxemburg’s cause was lost...for now. \nAs the perpetrators of failed coup d’etat walked out of building without their machine-pistols, remaining Ukrainian guards down from the rooftop to be awarded medals by the high command, and the prematurely awakened capital listening to crazy news, one thing was said by Skoropadsky while he observed the whole affair from his personal tank:"

Seldom not criticized, but still somewhat respectable president of Ukraine announced that elections will be held one year ahead of the schedule, with any parties which want to participate invited to. While quite obviously there are more than twenty parties in Ukraine, of them ten represented in earlier Rada and eight even having rather good results, only five parties are expected to make any serious gains in this election - Ukrainian Party of Socialist Revolutionaries, an agrarian leftist force backed by few sympathetic cooperators which chose a well-known historian Mykhailo Hrushevs’kyi as its presidential candidate; Ukrainian National-Democratic “Ob’yednannya” (Alliance) with its like-minded partner Ukrainian Party of Socialist Federalists, both of these being Liberal and delegating Yevhen Petrushevych and Dmytro Doroshenko respectively as presidential candidates; Ukrainian Democratic “Khliborobs’ka” (Peasant) Party - a conservative democratic party led by another historian and diplomat, Vyacheslav Lypynsky; and finally the party in power - Ukrainian Social Democratic “Robitnycha” (Labour) Party, as always supporting Petliura despite complaints from the internal opposition.

Truly, Pavlo Skoropadsky was maybe a bit too old to lead a country, but he knew that nobody else was truly capable. To save Ukraine from its worst evil - the treachery from within - one must be ready to sacrifice even one’s own life. Even if not at the frontlines, then surely due to overworking.\nWalking up to the podium, Pavlo wondered what kind of thoughts visited the heads of the previous speakers. Did they also burden themselves with the noble task of safeguarding Ukraine’s existence like him - or were they just parasites coming to power purely for personal gain? \"Whatever, that doesn’t matter now\" - he said to himself, fixing his uniform and looking at the audience.\n“My dear Ukrainians”, he spoke. “Today, our Republic stands at the edge of the abyss. It wasn’t long after the foreign subversives were stopped from taking over this very building, that our brave security servicemen have determined the source...and this source, the backer of a failed coup against our Republic, is the cowardly Spartacist nation of Germany!”\nSome deputies appeared to be worried, but it was old news to the majority - newspapers have published the whole story of stopping the VKSSS agents (written by Skoropadsky himself) a couple days ago already. A man in the USDRP section apparently knew already what was going to happen, as did a deputy or two in UPSR sector.\nSkoropadsky looked at the crowd with his piercing stare, and spoke - his words being carried around the country by radio and written down by the journalists:“I hereby proclaim the military’s authority over entire Ukraine, temporarily pausing the article of Constitution concerning the presidency, and dissolve the parliament in the name of Ukraine immediately, question of next elections being postponed until the salvation is brought to our Fatherland.”"

Daughter didn’t want to go, and the son said that he would fight to the bitter end, but father persuaded the kids to run. And only then, having his rifle grabbed, he walked to the front door. \nWhen two children were already a mile away from their village, they saw light. And no, it wasn’t just their house that was burning. Unable to satisfy their desire of carnage by slaughtering just one dissident, Drozdovites burned down the entire village. Those criminals, those marauders have shot on sight anyone trying to escape. The two kids who got over the border, the book still relatively intact, were the only villagers who have survived to tell this story.’ \nSo this is what our compatriots are fleeing. So this is kind of atrocities committed by the very people I once fought alongside against the Germans. - mused a middle-aged man in a comfy apartment in Kyiv, upon reading a newspaper article - one of the few, detailing the utter horror of how East Ukraine suffered under the occupiers’ boot."

Immediately, the teens’ parents were called, and then given a lengthy lecture on the necessity of combating foreign influences - the things which may appear as harmless hobbies, but that actually constitute a threat to Ukrainian traditional way of life.

New envelope, rolled into a cylinder - invitation to lunch. \nWhile in the elevator, Sofia thought about what was happening to her and around her in the past few months. Firstly, her brother, who had tuberculosis, got a rather cheap ticket by the so-called “Teliha programme” to Italy, where he was being healed while having his expenses covered by state medical budget, expanded by Mala Rada’s decree some three months ago. It was rather wonderful that airplanes now were both faster and cheaper, and (judging by her brother’s telegrams) pretty comfortable too - and it was a Ukrainian airlines’ plane, not French or British. Then, the overall goods’ quality was improved, Sofia had a pay high enough to buy a car - and yes, she no longer worked for that asshole landlord as his kids’ tutor, for she got a prestigious job at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs - where she was right now, enjoying a top quality lunch in a room done according to art deco style. And yes, while her own perspectives were wonderful, the ones of the state were even better. In the newsreel she had a glimpse of before going to lunch, Sofia saw that the great president Olena Teliha had intention of reclaiming Ukrainian territories beyond the Dnipro river, intention of entering the grand alliance of forces of progress - which was implied to be Fiume and France. Sofia’s grandma may disagree, but it was obvious to everyone else - whatever should be done to expand Ukraine’s glory is justified, because in the end, every Ukrainian will enjoy progress just as much as Sofia and her colleagues."

And here he was, walking out of factory gates, looking at the propaganda poster pinned to the front:\n“Lyudyna i mashyna pratsyuyut’ u harmonii”, or “Mann und Maschine arbeiten in Harmonie” in Frederick’s mother tongue. Here, life was different. No commissars to “check your proletarian loyalty”. No Proletarische Hunderschaften to terrorize you for your supposedly bourgeois activities. And the work itself was conducted as if it was a symphony - while working with both the locals and the foreign specialists, Frederick felt better than when he toiled in the armaments factory in his native Munich. \nGetting in his car and driving towards Odessa, Frederick checked his schedule. He had some time until a meeting with Natalka on Derybasivs’ka street, so he decided to visit the Potemkin stairs. It was kind of weird - labour here, in Ukraine, was regimented, but spirit was more optimistic, time schedule was rather strict, but he had more free time than before, and most importantly - Frederick, a former KPD activist, felt himself much more free to breathe when this very KPD was not around, but hundreds of kilometres away.

Although both Ukraine and the Kavkaz Society have expressed admiration and loyalty to Antonin Artaud, leader of the futurist French state, both leaders have expressed their desire for a futurist bloc that is “uniquely Slavic”, and outside the French sphere of influence. Although some expected Artaud to react with anger at such a proposition, Artaud was quoted as simply saying, “The only people in Europe who have never ruled the Slavs are the Slavs themselves.

UKR_left_bank_ukraine_desc:0 "At last, we shall finish what wasn’t done in 1922 - we shall reunify the two banks of Dnipro, and assert Ukraine to be a Ukraine of both banks! With the help of a popular revolt, Ukraine will reclaim the territories occupied by despicable Russian clique!"
UKR_our_cossack_brethen:0 "Our Cossack Brethren"
UKR_our_cossack_brethen_desc:0 "Reclaiming our Eastern Territories was just the beginning. Ukraine must achieve her true form by absorbing all the territories that rightfully belong to the Ukranian people. In order to do that, we must deal with the Russian warlords of the South-Eastern. While unlikely, we can demand their surrender before we crush them like ants. If our friends of the Chornomortsy were in power, maybe things could go easily. But to reach the Caspian Sea, looks like we need to put up a fight."
UKR_orenburg:0 "Orenburg Corridor"
UKR_orenburg_desc:0 "The proposal to crush the Orenburg District was already on the table of our government, even before annexing the Caucasus. But it was the Governor of the new Ukranian Governorate of the Kuban, Mykola Riabovil, that proposed to strike at this very moment to take advantage of the weakness of the Russian government. Our opponent is the Russian warlord Alexander Dutov. Probably one of the many Kolchak's bootlickers. Riabovil specially holds him in contempt, so this is his chance to repay any possible personal grievances. Once we step on his pseudo-fief and gain control of the region, the path for a Greater Ukraine will open."
UKR_claim_grey_ukraine:0 "Have Grey Ukraine join us"
UKR_claim_grey_ukraine_desc:0 "Once the corridor is secured, its true purpose is revealed. For those who have considered the Steppe to be half-Russian-half-Asian, the fabric of reality was torn, and the surprising truth was revealed - about an entire region with Ukrainian plurality, called Grey Ukraine, which must be secured by our Fatherland - by the ballot or by the bullet."
UKR_pacific_corridor:0 "Pacific Corridor"
UKR_pacific_corridor_desc:0 "To gain access to the Transcathay, first we need to achieve what some intellectuals and generals started calling \"The Pacific corridor\". While no part of those lands has even a small portion of Ukrainians in it, some may argue that Cossacks of Transbaikal are Ukrainians too, we still need those pieces of land to achieve our goals."
UKR_take_zheltorossiya:0 "Conquer Zheltorossiya"
UKR_take_zheltorossiya_desc:0 "Green Wedge, Green Ukraine, Transcathay. This place had so many names. But what is always true is that green Ukraine has an enormous amount of Ukrainians in it. How can we forsake their desire to join us, to return into gentle hands of their mother. We may die, but Transcathay will be Ukrainian."
UKR_lemkovyna:0 "Demand Lemkovyna"
UKR_lemkovyna_desc:0 "People of Lemkivshchyna have always been connected to their brethren in Carpathian Ukraine. If not for the disastrous outcome of the Independence War, we could have integrated this land into Ukraine a while ago. But now, another piece of Ukrainian territory shall be demanded from the unlawful occupiers."
