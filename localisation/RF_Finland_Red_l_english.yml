FIR_industrialize_abogelsingfors_area:0 "Industrialize Abo-Gelsingfors Area"
FIR_industrialize_abogelsingfors_area_desc:0 "We must admit that we are a backward nation, with almost nonexistent industry. Before we can help our exploited brothers elsewhere, we have to industrialize. Like Marx said, socialism can be built only in the industrial nations. We aren't that yet, but we will be!"
FIR_infrastructure_projects_in_north_finland:0 "Infrastructure Projects in North Finland"
FIR_infrastructure_projects_in_north_finland_desc:0 "Our nation hasn't been blessed with friendly neighbours or even a decent geopolitical spot. In the west, there lies Sweden, a reactionary monarchy with passionate hatred towards the liberators of the working class, and in the east, the great bear itself, who would like to have us back in their claws. If this wasn't bad enough, shared borders with these nations are largely in the north, the worst possible place in the whole country in the terms of infrastructure. The skiis aren't fast enough to move our troops, let alone to provide needed supplies to them… That is why we must build roads and railways in the north!"
FIR_join_germany_in_the_world_struggle:0 "Join Germany in the World Struggle"
FIR_join_germany_in_the_world_struggle_desc:0 "Germany is the uncontested leader of the world's socialist nations. We will join them in the shared struggle for world revolution and eternal freedom of the working class!"
FIR_from_people_to_people:0 "From People to People"
FIR_from_people_to_people_desc:0 "The way wealth is distributed in our society is unfair. We will do everything to redistribute that wealth to people who need it most, by the principle of 'each according to his ability, to each according to his need'."
FIR_forced_collectivization:0 "Forced Collectivization"
FIR_forced_collectivization_desc:0 "If something is sure in this unsure world, it is that people need food to survive. As our plan is to industrialise, we need it more than ever and current line the agriculture is organized, there will be a risk of famine. Reorganization along the line of collectivisation will meet some resistance, but we are stronger than few landowners."
FIR_peoples_councils:0 "People's Councils"
FIR_peoples_councils_desc:0 "Sirola and his radicals wanted to increase the power of a central authority as a way to bring prosperity to our country. Of course, everyone who thinks knows perfectly well that that would lead only to tyranny and slavery. For that reason Tokoi has proposed workers' self-management and creation of the People's council as a legislative body."
FIR_dictatorship_of_the_proletariat:0 "Dictatorship of the Proletariat"
FIR_dictatorship_of_the_proletariat_desc:0 "Primary goal of the international proletariat is to build socialism, so that one day transitioning to communism is possible.

FIR_radicals_in_power:0 "Radicals in Power"
FIR_radicals_in_power_desc:0 "Finnish nation is a ship:\n\nThe crew?\nFinnish workers, tirelessly building socialism!\nThe helmsman?\nThe great comrade Sirola, tirelessly leading this ship from storms of today to the sunshine of tomorrow!\nThe flag? \nRed as the coming morning, red as the blood of the proletariat, red as the immortal science of Leninism!"

FIR_moderates_in_power_desc:0 "By looking at history, you can see that radicalism only leads to vulgarity or even reactionary policies and forms of government, such as a cult of personality and dictatorship. Luckily, the general will has shown that there is no place for people like Sirola and his gang in red Finland."
FIR_purge_the_enemies:0 "Purge the Enemies"
FIR_purge_the_enemies_desc:0 "Engels said that "we shall not make excuses for terror". Let that be the guiding line for our party as we root out every kind of reactionary thinking found among our populace and inside of the party."
