montenegro.1.t:0 "The Kingdom of Montenegro"
montenegro.1.d:0 "After the chaos of the Great War and the subsequent collapse of Yugoslavia, the Kingdom of Montenegro expanded to include what was once northern Albania, elevating House Petrović-Njegoš’s importance in the Balkans.\n\nHowever, growing dissatisfaction from a mixture of unemployed youths, impoverished workers, and displaced war veterans towards the backward, agrarian Kingdom inspired a new political player to emerge: General Radole Gajdić. Gajdić, in addition to sharing the same concerns as many dissatisfied Montenegrins, also believed he could bring honor and respect to the commonly overlooked nation. This led to the formation of the Nacionalni Narodni Pokret, or National People’s Movement.\n\nWhen King Nikola I Petrović-Njegoš died in 1921, Gajdić and the NNP made their move the following year, arming themselves and marching on the royal palace in Cetinje to demand Gajdić lead the government. This march was well timed, since Danilo, new and untested, lacked the confidence and ability to refuse the armed march, resulting in Danilo caving to Gajdić’s demands. However, from 1922 to 1927, Gajdić and the NNP struggled to implement their desired reforms, as the existing political establishment and the monarchy were able to contest them at every step.\n\nThat changed when Danilo’s health declined greatly due to “an accident”, letting Gajdić and the NNP assert themselves to a greater degree. An aggressive modernization campaign centered around heavy investment into public works began soon after, effectively reversing the economic downturn. This energetic development, and subsequent economic gain, soon earned Gajdić the title of Vožd from the people. Gajdić even went as far as to begin empowering the trade unions in his modernization campaign, but not to a degree where they could freely disagree with Gajdić or his policies, and always centered around nationalistic principles. Nevertheless, this also weakened whatever cohesive socialist movements existed in Montenegro, as socialists were now divided over their opinion of the NNP. Some saw the NNP’s work with the trade unions and considered them the future, while others feared them to be reactionaries strong arming the proletariat.\n\nHowever, all good things must come to an end. The strain on the economy from excess spending, as well as sanctions from the UK and Italy over Montenegrin expansion into Albania, eventually halted the country’s upward trajectory. Gajdić, however,  had one final card up his sleeve. In a speech that will no doubt go down in the annals of history, he proclaimed that the Montenegrin people are the true inheritors of Rome, and that it was the duty of the new Montenegro to carry on its legacy. Outside viewers scoff at the notion, but a great excitement has swept over the small nation."

However, in the years since, the National People's Movement under General Radole Gajdić has garnered increasing popular support, taking advantage of the death of King Nikola I Petrović-Njegoš in 1921. Claiming the mantle of Rome as a political tool, Gajdić seeks to unify the Balkan people and drive off the barbarians and Italians alike."
