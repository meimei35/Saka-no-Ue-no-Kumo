#LEADER DESCRIPTIONS#
POLITICS_JINJIANG_DESC:0 "“Warlords, traitors, lackeys, tyrants, capitulators, speculators... No one could have predicted that the revolutionary sage would descend to such a state.”——Cheng Qian\n\nZhang Jingjiang was born in Huzhou in 1877. Influenced by anachronism in his youth, he began to use his family's assets to fund various anti-Qing groups, including Sun Yat-Sen's TongMengHui. Zhang Jingjiang's patronage played an important role in the early development of the KMT. Sun Wen affectionately called him "the sage of revolution" and he became one of the four elders of the KMT.\n\nZhang Jingjiang opposed the left-wing tendency of the KMT under the leadership of Song Jiaoren after the assassination of Sun Wen. He keenly observed the hysterical anti-communist sentiment of the old capitalist countries such as Britain and France after the emergence of a red regime in the industrial heart of Europe. When the Japanese beat spearhead of NRA in Shanghai, Zhang and Chen Qimei immediately began contacting the British and American concessions, seeking to use their party seniority and political status to establish a pro-western cooperative national government. After Chen QiMei is assassinated, Zhang gave up to Xu Chongzhi even the comfort of courtesy, go further and further through cooperating with foreign capitalists, oligarchs and Shanghai gangsters, avaricious and high-profile people cream. Six years after Zhang Jingjiang took over the Nanjing government, the KMT was further disintegrated, and many positions within the party were replaced by Gangs, landlords and warlords.\n\nZhang questioning the feasibility of a national revolution from the start. He has a clear understanding of himself and has a blueprint for China's future. The failure of the northern expedition made him understand that China could not complete a modern national revolution and had lost the capital to contend with the great powers. The more he cooperated with foreign capitalists, the stronger his position became."
