#LEADER DESCRITIONS#
POLITICS_SHENTON_THOMAS_DESC:0 "Sir Thomas Shenton Whitelegge Thomas is an old and experienced member of the British colonial service and had briefly worked as governor of Nyasaland before events in East Asia forced a career change. The collapse of the British Raj saw him be moved to the Strait settlements in Malaysia, before being quickly implemented as governor of the new Government of British Malaysia. While this was a event that Shenton would have liked to avoid in fear of causing native resistance, events had had overtaken him and in 1936 Shenton has finally got a solid grip over the organisation of Malaysian affairs. While there is resistance from not only native independence movements but also from old white settlers and rulers that want one of their own in charge and not a native londoner. However Shenton pays these critics little attention for there are always more pressing issues at hand and he, as always just like in Nyasaland, deals with them quickly."

#IDEAS#
MAL_economic_downturn:0 "Economic Downturn"
MAL_economic_downturn_desc:0 "When the London Stock Exchange crashed in 1931, Singapore and Malaysia were soon to follow. There dependence on Britain as their main export hub and integration in the global economy that had been shattered  caused the Malaysian economy to entre freefall. While it has been many years since the crash and the Malaysian economy has begun to improve, it will take many more years for Malaysia to fully recover."
MAL_communist_resurgence:0 "Communist Resurgence"
MAL_communist_resurgence_desc:0 "While rumored to having disintegrated in 1930, whispers in the slums of singapore, the villages of Malaysia and fields of Borneo all have the same rumours, that the South Seas Communist Party is back. While all colonial reports have denied the existence of a new South Seas Communist party, it is undeniable that increased amounts of communist propaganda are being found,and that when some british patrols go into the jungles, they never come back."
MAL_centralisation_issues:0 "Centralisation Issues"
MAL_centralisation_issues_desc:0 "Throughout the twentieth century Malaysia has been through multiple governors with different ideas on how to manage the colony. Malaysia has gone through multiple different waves of centralisation followed by decentralisation. Uniting the colony into the Malayan Union following the chaos in India is just another one of these cycles. However the sudden quick centralisation has created a complicated large bureaucracy and has allowed corruption to fester. It is up to Shenton Thomas only if he will once again foster decentralisation to fix these issues, or continue with centralisation and form a stronger Malaya."
