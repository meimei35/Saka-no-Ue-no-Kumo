#FOCUSES#
FIN_military_complex_owned_by_finns:0 "Military Complex owned by Finns"
FIN_military_complex_owned_by_finns_desc:0 "So far we are importing most of our equipment from the Motherland while the few military factories locally are owned by a Russian elite. If we want to meet the demands of our increasing ranks we need to make sure that our arms manufacturers are controlled by locals for maximum benefit."
FIN_open_up_in_a_moderate_pace:0 "Open up in a Moderate Pace"
FIN_open_up_in_a_moderate_pace_desc:0 ""
FIN_elections_of_the_new_government:0 "Elections of the new Government"
FIN_elections_of_the_new_government_desc:0 "So far Finland has been economically mismanaged as Russian elites failed to realize the economic possibilities free trade would be able to bring. It is time we open our country for business and attract foreign investors to promote our industry."
FIN_unification_of_lands_of_set:0 "Unification of Lands of Set"
FIN_unification_of_lands_of_set_desc:0 "We have reached the apex of our internal stability and internal consciousness - it is understood by every Finn that they are originating from the island of Java, and now it is clear to us that we must reach the unification of the Black Lands - which we will subsequently use as a launching ground for the invasion of the Red Land, which will comprise every element of the Fenno-Egyptian peoples in it's natural formation, and also to help gather resources for our grand adventure towards the great Nile."
FIN_sail_to_our_ancestral_lands:0 "Sail to our Ancestral Lands"
FIN_sail_to_our_ancestral_lands_desc:0 "We have done it. We have reached the absolute peak of the Black Land - from landmass to spiritual and material, to cosmic consciousness of our Fenno-Egyptian peoples we shall finally come to the Red Land, and take it over from our massively powerful jumping start, and take it from the shackles of Britain. We shall liberate it according to the wishes of our Pharaoh, and secure it from the horror of Arabization. We will finally secure the ancient place of the Fenno-Egyptian people, and eventually even consider taking over Java, the original ancient birthplace of the Fenno-Egyptian People!"
FIN_allies_from_beyond_uatur:0 "Allies from Beyond Uat-Ur"
FIN_allies_from_beyond_uatur_desc:0 "We cannot seize our cosmic consciousness in a world filled with ignorance alone. We need to assess realpolitik and find allies such as the League Solar which will help us in our conquest of our lands of Set and then after our unification with our Red Lands."
FIN_modern_carriage_of_amunra:0 "Modern Carriage of Amun-Ra"
FIN_modern_carriage_of_amunra_desc:0 "Our ancient arms and weapons are far too outdated to be used in current battle - especially against the Muscovite hordes. We must quickly get to work creating new beautiful carriages which Amun-Ra would be proud of, with beautifully ornate designs in its sides to confuse the enemy. We shall ensure that it's properties are made from the most mystical and cosmically treated steel, and that with it we shall lead Finland towards a new Future of consciousness."
FIN_rebirth_of_mummification_traditions:0 "Rebirth of Mummification Traditions"
FIN_rebirth_of_mummification_traditions_desc:0 "When one dies, their heart is weighted next to a feather by Osiris, who subsequently judges whether or not you receive a great bounty of wonder and happiness or misery and horror. One who lives lightly will die lightly, and will have their spirit raised beyond to the skies and to the Cosmos, with their belongings brought to them in great pyramids and inside of said vessels, a great coffin where they may be permanently preserved to secure their connection with the land."
FIN_society_of_thoth:0 "Society of Thoth"
FIN_society_of_thoth_desc:0 "Knowledge of the ancients has been lost for centuries, alongside knowledge of the Future which has never been attained due to lack of synchronization with the spiritual world. We shall create a new intellectual society, namely the Society of Thoth, to further expand intellectual capacities in the aristocratic realms of society and ensure that slowly but surely the people become more knowledgeable of the great truth of Fenno-Egytpianism."
FIN_great_pyramids_of_helsinki:0 "Great Pyramids of Helsinki"
FIN_great_pyramids_of_helsinki_desc:0 "A great tourist attraction of Egypt is their great pyramids, which interest and fascinate thousands of people every single day. Due to our lost connection, we never made said pyramids and lost our primal culture, becoming lost brothers in the Black Land. No longer - we shall create, by hand, great pyramids in Helsinki and other cities which will be even bigger than the pyramids of the Red Lands and show our might, and perhaps bring some tourists."
FIN_pharaoh_of_finland:0 "Pharaoh of Finland"
FIN_pharaoh_of_finland_desc:0 "This must be one of our most important decisions - and it is to declare Sigurd Wettenhovi-Aspa the first Pharaoh of the Thirty-Fourth Dynasty, the lost Dynasty of Egypt which finds itself in the Black Lands, lost in the darkness and which will rise towards the beacon of light, protecting the lost peoples, bringing them to their homeland and unifying with their brothers, who lost connection with them for thousands of years. Never again shall we be lost in the dark, unknowing of who we are as people, stuck in some miserable ideal of "Finno-Ugrianism", some nonsense which has no origin, no truth, and nothing of beauty."
FIN_seyns_execution:0 "Seyn's Execution"
FIN_seyns_execution_desc:0 "Now it is our time to take the offensive. The Russian slavers are brought to their knees and struggling, Finland must be free! The puppet-tyrant Seyn will be tried for his atrocities and shot accordingly at dusk already. It will be swift and deserving end of this miserable vermin, so that we can go back to business immidiately."
FIN_russian_overlordship:0 "Russian Overlordship"
FIN_russian_overlordship_desc:0 "Finland has always been loyal to the Russian cause. For centuries now we have been a subject off the glorious slavic empire and we must not forget our roots. The years to come spell trouble for the world and our nation in particular, we must remain sure that every precautionary measure has been taken to guarantee that we will prevail."
FIN_storm_in_central_russia:0 "Storm in Central Russia"
FIN_storm_in_central_russia_desc:0 "Turmoil is brewing in the lands of our Russian overlords. A political feud has erupted into full fledged Civil War with no clear indicator of which path the Russians are heading. This presents us with numerous consequences as our own status remains unclear itself. There is already talks of overthrowing sentiments inside the opposition as the continued Russification and absence of Russian garrisons presents us with a powder keg about to burst into flames any second..."
FIN_dreams_of_old_fatherland:0 "Dreams of Old Fatherland"
FIN_dreams_of_old_fatherland_desc:0 "After the death of the King, many became completely disillusioned with the nonsense spouted by the Pro-Monarchists, who are all Prussians and foreigners, likely uninterested in the wellbeing of Finnish people in general. Therefore, Aspa and his forces, such as Edward Juutilainen's soldiers, have marched on Helsinki and declared the Thirty-Fourth Dynasty, as we dream of Aspa's fantastical theories of a lost Egypt in the Black Lands of Finland where he theorizes the Finnish people originated from Java, and subsequently went on a journey from there to Egypt, and lived there until Roman times where a portion of them went to Finland, and settled there after a painful and horrific travel. These theories have taken the appeal of former Kekkonenists, who believe that the national myth of Finno-Ugrianism is far too... un-authentic, and lacks the true feeling that is given by Aspa's ideas, which have many facts described in his linguistical books that have become far too impossible to deny for many. Therefore, Aspa now rules unopposed in Helsinki, which he plans on renaming soon."
FIN_continue_russification:0 "Continue Russification"
FIN_continue_russification_desc:0 "We must learn from our overlords progresses and adopt their ways even further. To make sure, that we do not strive off our glorious path we need to make sure to promote our Russian nobility and further introduce the Russian language mandatorily into our curriculum. This is the only way, that we can fulfill the demands of our servitude."
FIN_promote_russian_settlement:0 "Promote Russian Settlement"
FIN_promote_russian_settlement_desc:0 "Our lands are far and wide, but are sparsely populated in some areas. Why don't we offer our glorious overlords a piece of land for their own use, so that Dave may be used in a more orderly fashion? This is truly a deal that we can mutually profit from."
FIN_restore_broken_connections:0 "Restore broken Connections"
FIN_restore_broken_connections_desc:0 "We have been lost from our Egyptian brothers for thousands of years, after we have heroically fled from Roman yoke and settled in Finland after a Great Trek through the Dnieper, the Urals, and subsequently through the lands which we inhabit today - the Black Lands. We now must re-establish connections with Egyptian scholars that hate Arabism like us, such as Taha Hussein and will be willing to support us in the fight for Egyptian National Rejuvenation. Never again will we lose our eternal bond with our peoples of the Red Lands."
FIN_finnish_hieroglyphy:0 "Finnish Hieroglyphy"
FIN_finnish_hieroglyphy_desc:0 "For far too long we have been stuck to the Latin alphabet, forced and shackled to it's limitations in expression and lack of creativity. No longer - we shall forever learn our children to use hieroglyphics, and their children's children will learn hieroglyphics, and so on for all eternity. No one will take our writing system from us ever again."

FIN_balticnubian_mercenaries_desc:0 ""
FIN_democratic_coup:0 "Democratic Coup"
FIN_democratic_coup_desc:0 "Just as we imagined it would happened Helsinki experienced a coup last night with the military stepping in place of the parliament. It seems like the future of our nation is guided towards a more democratic approach as parties are voicing their concerns with the previous governmental practices and abuse of power."
FIN_slowly_reverse_russification:0 "Slowly Reverse Russification"
FIN_slowly_reverse_russification_desc:0 "The Russification of our country was a terrible mistake which did more harm than good! We need to undo the strict changes brought forward foolishly and realize that our own identity will give us the stability needed to face the challenges the future has in store for us."
FIN_suojelijan_kuoleman_henki:0 "Suojelijan Kuoleman Henki"
FIN_suojelijan_kuoleman_henki_desc:0 "We have to face that our existance is dedicated purely to the Finnish nation. We are nothing but servants of our kinsmen and must realize that even death will not be able to frighten us when we fight for this greater cause."
FIN_empower_the_vihan_veljet:0 "Empower the Vihan Veljet"
FIN_empower_the_vihan_veljet_desc:0 "The Brothers of Hate were among the most influential militant group to support our independence and they have helped us greatly in the aftermath of the coup. It is time we give them the place in oursociety that they are deserving of by organizing them as a paramilitary militia to safeguard our landsif we are ever under attack again."
FIN_our_enemies_will_never_receive_forgiveness:0 "Our enemies will Never receive Forgiveness"
FIN_our_enemies_will_never_receive_forgiveness_desc:0 "Just like we will never expect an opponent to treat us kindly, as tyrants are lurking in the shadows, we will not be merciful either. Will an enemy ever dare to face us in battle we will either slay him ordie a glorious death in the face of battle."
FIN_and_his_loyal_people:0 "And his loyal People"
FIN_and_his_loyal_people_desc:0 "Every citizen is a tribesman of Kekkonen as much as he is a fighter of his ranks. We must strenghten this bond with our people to make them realize the glorious gift of his words. He is the spirit of a reborn Finnish state."
FIN_all_praise_kekkonen_all_praise_the_saviour:0 "All praise Kekkonen, all praise the Saviour"
FIN_all_praise_kekkonen_all_praise_the_saviour_desc:0 ""Finland used to be at the crossroads of existance until Kekkonen ascended to lead our people to glory. The embodyment of everything that defines the idea of Sisu he will be lead us to the gates of hell. We are destined to sacrifice our lives for a greater Finnic realm!"
FIN_carve_out_a_land_just_for_finns:0 "Carve out a Land just for Finns"
FIN_carve_out_a_land_just_for_finns_desc:0 "Our time to shine has come. We have risen from the ashes and revitalized the ancient spirit of Finnish existance as the unshakeable leadership of Kekkonen guides us. May the gods guard us in battle as we march forward to reclaim our lost lands in the east which have pained our hearts for far too long."
FIN_limitless_militarisation:0 "Limitless Militarisation"
FIN_limitless_militarisation_desc:0 "The Finnish people are a defiant kind for we have learned to endure suffering with a smile. But no longer will we be slaves of a foreign people! It is time to beat the drums of war and mobilize our society to the fullest extend. Every Finn must learn to be a soldier at heart!"
FIN_finnougric_supremacy:0 "Finno-Ugric Supremacy"
FIN_finnougric_supremacy_desc:0 "The vile Russians made us believe that we were nothing but peasants even though we are an ancient kind. Deep to the heart of the Urals we were settled before the slavs were making us slaves and deliberately destroyed our history. Never again will anyone be able to bury our history as the Finnic kind stands tall."
FIN_pllikk_kekkonen:0 "Päällikkö Kekkonen"
FIN_pllikk_kekkonen_desc:0 "Urho Kaleva Kekkonen has been a fighter of the first hour and a respected senior leader of our society. He is one of the most skilled figures and dedicated fully to the Finnish cause. Kekkonen embodies the role of a liberator more than anyone else in this nation."
FIN_question_of_power:0 "Question of Power"
FIN_question_of_power_desc:0 "The king has been crowned, but the constitution has not been written yet... The question is if it should remain like that.

FIN_alliance_of_force:0 "Alliance of Force"
FIN_alliance_of_force_desc:0 "Any alliance that is not based on war is a useless one! If Finland is to pick a partner it must be one that is ready and willing to stand up for the sake of our cause. United in strength nothing in this world is going to be able to stop us!"
FIN_question_of_borders:0 "Question of Borders"
FIN_question_of_borders_desc:0 "Our borders are a crudely defined mess as pragmatist elements clash with irredentist noblemen. It is time we take a decisive stand on how our royal clique stands on the matter before this becomes an internal problem."
FIN_alliance_of_brotherhood:0 "Alliance of Brotherhood"

FIN_karelian_academic_society:0 "Karelian Academic Society"
FIN_karelian_academic_society_desc:0 "Unbeknownst to the Russians our intelligensia has been drawn to pan-nationalist ideas in the underground for ages now.

With the problem solving itself now we can finally bring our vision of Finland into fruition."
FIN_german_glory:0 "German Glory"
FIN_german_glory_desc:0 "The German nobility has long embodied defiance and sublimity as they are shaped by battles like none alike.

FIN_and_finnish_power:0 "And Finnish Power"
FIN_and_finnish_power_desc:0 "We have been underestimated for far too long already!

FIN_question_of_nations:0 "Question of Nations"
FIN_question_of_nations_desc:0 "Now that we have established our position on the international stage it is time to clarify who is friend or foe.

Now it is time for us to pick our alliances."
FIN_finns_in_high_positions:0 "Finns in High Positions"
FIN_finns_in_high_positions_desc:0 "It makes absolutely no sense how the Russian nobility clings onto positions of power while we Finns have aspiring talents ourselves!

FIN_expand_finnish_trading_company:0 "Expand Finnish Trading Company"
FIN_expand_finnish_trading_company_desc:0 "While the Russians certainly had taken a few economic missteps we can not underestimate the usefulness of the Finnish trading company founded to exploit the resources.

FIN_tax_foreign_nobility:0 "Tax Foreign Nobility"
FIN_tax_foreign_nobility_desc:0 "Rich landowners have been granted massive estates and riches while free of taxation themselves.

FIN_start_army_separation:0 "Start Army Separation"

FIN_we_are_part_of_russia_for_now_desc:0 "With the Russian grip loosened on our nation substantially our relationship becomes less of a colony and more of a dominion. Maybe this will be able to usher in an age of peaceful cooperation as we both stand aside as partners for one common cause."

FIN_rally_up_the_monarchists_desc:0 "A lot of people in our country have been yearning for a rightful leadership since ages with the abuse of power on the hands of the Russians. Nobody has been voicing their opinion to institutionalize our power in the form of a monarchy more than the noblemen that have been arguing for Finnish representation against Russian centralization for ages now. We must strengthen their position in our government as we institutionalize a court."
FIN_supreme_reaction:0 "Supreme Reaction"
FIN_supreme_reaction_desc:0 "Foes are surrounding us internally and externally. We must be prepared to face them by the sword and ready to defend what our people have fought for.

fin.1.t:0 "The Grand Duchy of Finland in 1936"
fin.1.desc:0 "Finland has been part of Russia for more than 130 years, and it shows - we have had an increasing number of Russians come to Finland and colonize places like Viipuri and Helsinki, and subsequently the name of our administrative cities have been officially changed to the Russian names first, and Finnish names second. \n\n This has resulted in many rebellions, and an especially harsh one in 1905 where the Finns rose up against their Russian masters and nearly succeeded in taking all of Finland, but were harshly put down by the gigantic Russian Imperial Army, subsequently resulting in a harsh regency led by Pehr Evind Svinhufvud af Qvalstad, who was then assasinated a few years later resulting in complete anarchy of Finnish society, where no one knew the allegiance of their countrymen. The nation was practically at a permanent state of civil war, and this resulted in the Russians entering with their Army and subsequently place Franz Albert Seyn as regent of Grand Duke of Finland, appointed by Kolchak. Now Finland sits in a situation of near chaos once more, where even the slightest misstep would result in total loss of the Kolchakocracy present and the social order..."
fin.1.a:0 "Ne meist on kultaiset."
fin.2.t:0 "The perfect opportunity or certain doom?"
fin.2.desc:0 "Russia is again in chaos, but maybe it is exactly what we want? While Kolchack loyalists are in a deadly clash with Drozdovsky forces we might seize this opportunity. With every single man thrown into the slaughter in the south, the Petrograd is left undefended. If we take the ancient capital of Russia, we will be able to gain much-needed legitimacy, gain the respect of the army and unite the divided nation. And proclaim ourselves as the Regent of Russia!\nAt the same time, this is indeed a gamble, and it is impossible to predict that might happen for this operation to fail. But inaction sometimes is even worse and could be perceived as a sign of weakness of Seyn's rule."
fin.2.a:0 "Send our armies down south!"
fin.2.b:0 "Wait, maybe it is not such a good idea..."

fin.3.t:0 "The End of the Rope"
fin.3.desc:0 "The operation was a complete failure. Our soldiers were massacred, the word is already spreading through the nation. After receiving the disastrous news, Albert Seyn locked himself in his office. After many hours, when the sun started to settle, he still had a bottle in his one hand and crumpled report in the other. Frustrated he shouted for his Adjutant but received no answer. He shouted more, but only deafening silence replied to him. Seyn, instead of getting angry, instead felt unease. He left his office and called for his guards. No reply. This was the moment then Grand Duke began to panic. He was running around his residence, screaming, begging for his servants. Tired, breathless, he slowly settled in his chair. He tried to deny, the scary thought at the back of his mind but now he understood. The horrifying realization entered his mind when he looked in the window. Two columns of soldiers were marching in his direction. He wanted to reach for the revolver, but was unable to move, all strength left his body. When soldiers entered his office and stated that 'he was accused of treason and was under arrest', he did not resist. His fate was sealed.\n\nFive days later Franz Albert Seyn The Grand Duke of Finland was executed by his own soldiers."
fin.3.a:0 "High stakes demand high price."

fin.4.t:0 "Nation spirals into chaos"
fin.4.desc:0 "The weakness and indecisiveness of the Grand Duke angered people to no extent. Finland is engulfed in strikes and protests. Both Russians and Finns demand reforms and openly show their resentment to the government. A large crowd is marching in Helsinki, demanding the abdication of Franz Albert Seyn. Soldiers refused to fire upon the crowd and are joining them. Now, after the peaceful protest entered the government palace in Helsinki and local forces loyal to Seyn have defected more and more, it seems that Seyn's corruption, oligarchial madness and nonsensical choices in the past have finally come up to him. People across Finland sing in the praises of democracy as the people of Finland begin propping up wooden ballot boxes across the nation in a symbolic action, implying that the current Government was illegitimate and that the first Finnish elections in history will begin this month."

fin.5.t:0 "Military chooses a sucesssor"
fin.5.desc:0 "After the military's putsch against Seyn post-his attempt to seize Petrograd, which resulted in total disaster and subsequent collapse of Russian rule in Finland, Finland has been under the rule of a military junta for some time. It is believed that our people cannot and will not stand for an unelected military junta without any ideological programme to stand on it's own and subsequently many generals have begun talking. Many of them support a monarchy led by a foreign monarch, such as Ernest August of Hanover, who will be crowned Ilmari I upon ascension to the throne. Others, or pretty much the majority, would support the takeover of Urho Kekkonen, an ultranationalist irredentist and militaristic leader who promise national pride to Finland."

And now that we, a deeply reactionary Government in Finland have successfully seized power after a chain of events which very few could predict, and subsequently have decided to rise from the Karelian swamps and declare our government illegitimate, rising from Viipuri and have begun marching towards Helsinki! We have begun to place our troops towards Helsinki but they seem unusually powerful, it appears they have been waiting for this moment for decades..."

He subsequently is forced to fall down to the ground, and asked to say his last words. Finns around the street looked in horror, with a journalist prepared to take Seyn's final picture. \n\n 'Any last words, traitor?' An unknown officer said. \n\n 'Give me water, for my journey to the Heavens will be long and arduous, for my sins were greaat. My journey in life ends here, and my name will be remembered.' After his short pause of two seconds, the chamber of the revolver turned, and the hammer punched the bullet forward, the bullet entering his skull and piercing through his dura matter, ravaging through his brain and causing an immense spectrum of emotions at one second, and then..."

This has resulted in immense hatred of the new German-born king, and his personal family, who they believe to be Prussian pawns trying to take over the country like it's 1918 all over again. Subsequently, an unnamed assailant went in front of the King during one of his speeches, and subsequently, in only a few seconds..."

However, it appears that many with the country, including multiple generals that formerly sided with Kekkonen and Aspa, believed that the death of the King proves how weak a Monarchy in Finland would be, and subsequently have decided to march on Helsinki and attempt to dissolve the Regency Council. Due to lack of power and lack of powerful generals that sided with the Regency Council, eventually the Council was dissolved and the local generals have chosen Sigurd-Wettenhovi Aspa, who seemed as detached as possible from the King's Pro-Prussian machinations, and subsequently resulted in Kekkonen's falling as an important figure in Finnish politics..."

fin.10.t:0 "Finno-Russian Ethnic Friendship Grows"
fin.10.desc:0 "Although we have not always seen eye to eye with Russia, our decision to put out an olive branch to our former nemeses was surprisingly fruitful. Our peoples now enjoy a friendship which is bound to last through the ages, and more importantly, the Finns can finally breathe a sigh of relief, not having to fear Russian aggression. What once was like a sleeping bear, waiting for its chance to strike and devour us whole, is now more like a quirky uncle who is beloved by the family despite his lack of trustworthiness. Russo-Finnish immigration rates have never been higher, with our people feeling free to roam back and forth between the lands of two new friends. However, there are some vocal critics in both Russia and Finland who believe that this new relationship undermines Russia and Finland’s respective positions in the world. Russians believe that their once-mighty empire is suddenly supplicating itself to a breakaway subject state, and Finns believe that being a Russian lapdog is no better than living under their heels. Despite this, Finnish and Russian leaders have expressed warm relations to one another, and seemingly have no expectations of distancing their relationship."

fin.11.desc:0 "Foreign minister Kailas was woken up by his protege, Saima Harmaja (who was also working as a housekeeper to him), at five this morning, an hour before his usual schedule. A telegram had arrived from Finnish ambassador in France, a noted poet Kaarlo Sarkia, about something urgent. At first, Kailas couldn't believe what he was reading. Then, slowly he started to realize that what he had in his hands was without doubt one of the greatest things that had happened to the nation during his career as foreign minister. A telegram was sent back to France and Kailas readied to encounter the Pharaoh himself. At eight, he was waiting in the Palace's main hall and ten minutes later a servant showed Kailas the way to the inner chambers of the building. The Pharaoh was enjoying some tea as Kailas entered the room and bowed down before Him. Pharaoh, who didn't like his ministers to show such humbleness cleared his throat and asked what was the reason for this visit, that made Him wake up two hours earlier than usual. Kailas got up and began briefing the telegram to Pharaoh. \nSarkia had found a young Egyptian academic, called Taha Hussein, who was visiting France in an Egyptian futurist delegation. This man had written controversial, yet celebrated works on pre-islamic poetry and critiques of British colonial rule as well as Arab society. Sarkia knew straight away that this man could be of use to us, he could even be sympathetic to our ideas. Sarkia had proposed to Hussein that he should examine the relationship of Coptic languages and Finnish. Hussein, who didn't know anything about Finnish language, was hesitant, but with certain conditions would accept the task. After Kailas was done, there was a moment of silence. At last, Pharaoh spoke and said that Hussein should be provided with everything he wanted, a course in Finnish and funding.\nNot long after twelve, as the answer of Pharaoh was sent, another telegram arrived. Hussein accepted and ad already begun the work."

Now, various Coptic militias have risen up with us led by Taha Husssein in rebellion against the government aswell, bolstering our numbers and our legitimacy.

In an official statement, the Finnish government stated, “A little-known fact about Hungary and Finland is that our peoples actually have common history as Uralic tribesmen. Although we Socialists are not overly concerned with ethnicities and the pseudoscience known as ‘race’, socialist internationalism has provided us with an opportunity to explore and celebrate our shared history.” The Hungarians have responded similarly, with overtures of admiration for the versatility of Finland against the Russian juggernaut. Some of the more nationalistic party members in both nations have expressed concerns that too much co-dependence will erode both Finnish and Hungarian national identities, which are vital to protect in the face of Russian and Austrian imperialism respectively.
