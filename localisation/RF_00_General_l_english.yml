Warlords battle it out for who will be the true ruler of China, and across the Himalayas similar warlords fight over the destiny of India while the British desperately try to hold on. Meanwhile Japan consumed by it's own imperialism does not see the collapse of its nation swiftly approaching. The Sun is setting on many Empires, but will be rising on others..."
OTHER_THE_RISING_FLOOD_DESC:0 "Amid the chaos of the 20th Century there are many nations simply trying to survive the economic and ideological chaos. Some will have to pick a side in the coming conflict while others may choose their own paths."
