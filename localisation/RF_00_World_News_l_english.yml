worldnews.1.t:0 "Noskereich - The Lost Freedom"
worldnews.1.d:0 "German communist Writer Bruno Apitz recently published a book called \"Lost Freedom\". In this book, the German Revolution failed due to the purge of Gustav Noske, a social democrat infamous for his support of the counterrevolution. With the help of the military and the capitalists, Noske transformed Germany into an authoritarian-militaristic state. \"Lost Freedom\" follows a young German’s struggle against his own regime supported by comrades from anarchist Iberia and Connolly’s socialist Ireland. The story hinted that USA, France and the Russian Republic are in a Pact, while Great Britain has fallen under the rule of ultranationalists due to the loss of Ireland and several colonies. In the end, the main character, together with his comrades, overthrew the regime and freed Germany. Due to the prominent role of Noske, the book was nicknamed \"Noskereich\". It received good reviews by socialist medias, claiming that it would show the horror that would be a counter-revolutionary Germany. However, all reviews, regardless of political affiliation could not help but notice that the alternative history Apitz presents is very far streched and hardly believable. The author responded to that criticism by stating that he had not intended to be fully realistic. But he also jokingly added that this could have happened in an \"Alternate Timeline\"."

worldnews.2.d:0 "Pan-Asian author, Buddhist-socialist thinker and ex-Imperial Army officer Ishiwara Kanji published his controversial new novel “To Live Another Day: The Final Battle”. The story is about the love tragedy between a Japanese soldier and a Chinese girl during the \"Final War\" between the east and west. \nThe background of the story is the most eye-catching part of the work. In China, Prince Sengge Rinchen was killed by a British rocket in the Battle of Zhangjiawan in on 18 September 1865, resulting Empress Dowager Cixi’s Xinyou Coup in November failed and the success of \"Qixiang Restoration\" that effectively turned China into an industrialized constitutional monarchy.

Britain and France tightened their grips over their colonies, while Russian turned to a reactionary theocratic monarchy. American democracy was toppled by a coalition of white supremacists and industrial magnates led by Henry Ford, creating a technocratic racist empire."

A variety of fictional weapons were adopted on the battlefield, including unmanned aircrafts, biochemical weapons and energy beam cannons. The title \"To Live Another Day\" refers to the last sentence of the protagonist's closest comrade before the atomic anniliation, when both sides launched their secret weapons in a desperate attempt to break the decade-long stalemate.\nThe book was criticised for radical racism and horrific descriptions of atrocities in the name of racial justice. Ishiwara responded that such catastrophe could happen in another reality, as \"they will never treat us equally no matter how successful we are, unless we stand united against their superiority.\""

news.intro.d:0 "Red Flood is an Alternate-History scenario based upon the idea \"What if no-one won WWI?\". In 1905 Russia 'won' the Russo-Japanese War, strengthening the Monarchy until Tsar Nicholas II was assassinated in 1911.  This set a chain of events in motion that led to WWI breaking out in 1913 after the 2nd Balkan War drew Austria-Hungary and Russia to blows. The Triple Entente and Central Powers fought for years but eventually the war fizzled out, the French Army collpased, Russia fell into chaos at the death of Tsar Alexei II and Spartakist uprisings in Germany deposed the Monarchy. Britain could only look on in horror as the continent tore itself apart, its Empire also grew increasingly unstable. In the East Japan snatched up a colonial empire - overextending itself in the process - the USA, dismayed at the state of the world, doubled down on its isolationism. \nA new movement has swept Europe in the years since the end of the war, Accelerationism. The highly artistic and chauvinist political manifestation of extreme modernism, its growth began after the Italian radicals seized the city of Fiume in 1919 and has been a thorn in the side of Marxists, Monarchists and Moderates alike ever since. In 1934 France fell under the influence of its own Accelerationist movement, now the leader of the Avant Guard State - Antonin Artaud - prepares France to bring the future to the rest of the world by force."

The People's Oprinchina, the intelligence agency for the Russian Soviet Empire, has become one of the most efficient and powerful intelligence agencies on Earth, and Anastasia has managed to even get collaboration from some former enemies in Zheltorossiya. As a new, Accelerationist power, Russia now seeks to reclaim her old territories, and will do anything in her power to ensure that the Motherland is fully united under a new, progressive system."

news.39.desc:0 "Railroads are the future of a nation, so say the managers of the Russian Empire, led by their Emperor. After decades of attempts to colonize and integrate Central Asia, it appears the Russian Empire has finally succeeded, with entire villages disappearing off the map and new ones springing up, entirely composed of ethnic Russians looking for new farming opportunities, all brought in by rail as the trains leave for somewhere unknown. Now with the most complete train system in the World, Russia has become the master of infrastructure across large expanses of land, and has become absurdly wealthy with it. Now, perhaps Russia will truly go from Harbin to Petrograd."

news.100.desc:0 "It seems the ideological differences between the French government and the Socialist Republic of Germany have finally escalated to the point of armed conflict. Yesterday, Antonin Artaud announced that the government would finally intervene to “advance the futurist cause against the degenerate notion of marxism prevalent in the Socialist Republic of Germany and avenge the atrocities commited against French people during the Great War”, 6 hours later French forces crossed the border into Alsace, with fighting escalating it seems that Europe is engulfed in the flames of war yet again, and the few critics of war are silenced in horror as the world waits for yet another event of horrific loss of life. The germans however see this as a definitive proof of the capitalist’ classes hard grip over the futurist regime, and as a final test for the dream of world-socialism. Time will tell however if the horrors of war will be worth it for the continent of Europe."

news.101.desc:0 "The delicate and fragile balance in Europe has finally been shattered as the Patron of France, Antonin Artaud, made a speech in Le Soleil declaring war on the United Kingdom."Comrades, warrior-poets, riders of steel horses, priests of war, and lovers of art!"\nHe put down his cane and adjusted his scarf.\n"This crucial moment is our chance! We shall paint a great image over Britain! We will paint with our bombs, with our cars, and with their own blood. The plutocratic and reactionary regime of the United Kingdom has forced us to stand our ground and protect the oppressed masses of the world against the rotting corpse that is Anglo culture! The heart of this cancer, a bastion for the intellectually dull and meandering bourgeoisie is LONDON!"\nHe proclaimed, slamming his cane against the ground, and screaming energetically with dramatic, cathartic, and visceral gestures.\n"Our troops are ready to fight! The Acéphale have that their rituals and sacrifices are complete, so we can trust the Celtic gods in aiding our invasion!"\nArtaud then left the podium, walking over to a plane with speakers fitted on its sides.\n"The Anglo race has even failed to achieve the simplest of tasks - satisfying their women! We must help these poor souls out!"\nThe wise words of Le Patron echoed across our solar capital.\n"After our victory, we will put the Anglos in their rightful, historical place as a race of cuckolds! Our first aircrafts are on their way to London right now to drop lewd pictures of our troops, and love letters to future wives across The Channel."\nArtaud then flew away, throwing roses and firing his pistol into the air, to the clamor and praise of the residents of our great city."
