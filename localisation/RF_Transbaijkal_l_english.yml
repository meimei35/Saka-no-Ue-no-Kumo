MO2_SETTING_SUN_DESC:0 "A Cossack Nation, some believe this to be an oxymoron, a pipe dream, a ridiculous notion. Not to Grigory Semoyonov, he is the master of the Cossack warlord state in Transbaikal. In the aftermath of the Russian Civil War Semoynov took his cavalrymen and took over the territory east of Lake Baikal under the pretext of defending the region from the Republicans. Shortly after the occupation his bandit state took the shape it has today, a lawless and criminal clique of Cossack and Buryat bandits. With his neighbours recovering from the chaos of the '20s Semyonov is now obligated to commit to nation building or risk being removed."

#LEADER DESCRIPTIONS#
POLITICS_Semyonov_DESC:0 "There is nothing that hasn't been said about Grigory Semyonov, rivals and friends alike have called him a madman, hedonist, murderer and visionary in many colourful ways, yet it all makes no difference as those who dare talk ill of him eventually end up as target practice for his regiments. Born in his homeland of Transbaikal grew up much like the average peasant at the time would, managing to learn Buryat and Mongol shortly before joining the Russian army, graduating from the Orenburg Military School in 1908 as a yesaul, seeing combat in the Great War and the later Russian Civil War in the Caucasus. In July 1917, he was appointed as the commissar of the provisional government of Transbaikal, and stayed in his position right until the end of the war, remaining the leader of the region as a reward for his exemplary actions. As he grew older, he grew more bitter and hedonistic, becoming an alcoholic, lashing out against others irrationality - leading up to the year of 1925 when he organised the Cossack regiments under his command to take over the province and declare independence from Moscow as the Transbaikal Cossack Host. The reasons behind his secession are vague, some think it was motivated by Semyonov's Buryat nationalism, others thought that Semyonov grew resentful over Kolchak and his autocratic rule over Russia's minorities. With the 20's coming to a close, the reality of this near-anarchist militaristic society began kicking in as societal order broke down and banditry became a common theme of life in the province, much do the contrast of Semyonov's former courageous persona. However, one thing that had not vanished after all these years were Semyonov's ambitions for his impoverished homeland..."

mo2.1.t:0 "The Battle for Mongolia"
mo2.1.d:0 "Mongolia is divided, Sternberg's fanatics control the North-West, the Anhui the rump of the once independent nation, with us leading the Buryats and both Altay and Xinjiang competing on the periphery. The battle for supremacy in the region is fast approaching, who will win the Battle for Mongolia?"
mo2.1.a:0 "May the best man win."
#mo2.1.b:0 ""

mo2.2.t:0 "Support from the Church"
mo2.2.d:0 "Semyonov has successfully petitioned the church leaders in Chita and Ulan-Ude for support of his policies. During the conclave called to debate the matter some of the priests protested, a few called Semyonov a heretic, others viewed the move as a means of expanding the reach of Russian loyalist elements in Transbaikal. While the Eparchies are divided there is no denying the Ataman, in the end he will get his support, any turbulent priests who abstain may find themselves the victims of a bandit raid."
mo2.2.a:0 "S na mi Bog."
#mo2.2.b:0 ""

mo2.3.t:0 "Minorities of Transbaikal"
mo2.3.d:0 "Transbaikal is home to a few different peoples, principally Russians and Buryats, there are however a number of other peoples that call this land home. Tatars, Armenians, Ukrainians, Evenks and Jews among others, the issue of whether to integrate these peoples into the burgeoning Cossack culture of Transbaikal or to grant them cultural and even territorial autonomy is an issue that cannot be kicked down the road if Transbaikal is to succeed."
mo2.3.a:0 "Grant them Autonomy"
mo2.3.b:0 "Force their Integration"

mo2.31.t:0 "Minorities Granted Autonomy"
mo2.31.d:0 "The decision to grant the Transbaikalian minorities autonomy has been met with relief in many parts of the districts, more than a century of russification policies have finally come to an end for some of the people here. The news has attracted attention from neighbouring Republics and Oblasts where such policies are unthinkable under the Russian Yoke, some talk of Transbaikal as a sanctuary for the scattered and downtrodden Siberian peoples."
mo2.31.a:0 "That should shut them up."
#mo2.31.b:0 ""

mo2.4.t:0 "Integration Programs Announced"
mo2.4.d:0 "The new Cossack state cannot be achieved while cultural dissidents persist - so came the proclaimation from Chita, Semyonov announced new legal measures on the use of non-slavic languages and cultural practices. Many having seen the measures coming are already preparing to move away to more accepting lands, mostly westward towards the Intermarium or Imperial Governorates."
mo2.4.a:0 "They will have to like it."
#mo2.4.b:0 ""

mo2.5.t:0 "Language Reform Instituted"
mo2.5.d:0 "Since Transbaikal is not strictly Russian and Cossacks from across the Empire often don't speak it, there is a necessary step to be taken in developing this nation - a language reform. By introducing a contructed Cossack speech made from Russia, Ukrainian and Mongol, we can accomodate everyone and develop our own identity."
mo2.5.a:0 "Ti govorish Kozak?"
#mo2.5.b:0 ""

mo2.6.t:0 "The Wild of the Far-East"
mo2.6.d:0 "Bandits, Thieves, Mercenaries, Traditional Nomads, Transbaikal has them all in abundance. The people in the region have been driven to desperate measures and outside of the two largest cities the land is in near anarchy, it will take a strong leader to reign them in."
mo2.6.a:0 "The lunatics in Belotsarsk are more civil than us."
#mo2.6.b:0 ""

mo2.7.t:0 "Taming Siberia"
mo2.7.d:0 "As new policies are implemented and the general prosperity of the nation increases, criminals are given the opportunity to lay down their arms. Many of the people at the root of the general disorder are now the instruments of its elimination as workers. Soon this wild corner of Siberia will be tamed."
mo2.7.a:0 "Our rule must tame the Taiga."
#mo2.7.b:0 ""

mo2.8.t:0 "Stablity in the East"
mo2.8.d:0 "Once a land of abject poverty and anarchy, Transbaikal has wrestled control over its lands from the chaos and crime that was wrought from the Ataman's own Highwayman-like leadership following the civil war. The reforms have born fruit and the people are now orderly and productive, soon Transbaikal will be prosperous among its less fortunate neighbours."
mo2.8.a:0 "At Last!"
#mo2.8.b:0 ""

mo2.9.t:0 "The Trial"
mo2.9.d:0 "With the people closest to him having finally run out of patience, the Ataman has been arrested, charged with all manner of crimes against the people of Transbaikal and now faces court. The trial is of course little more than a formality, Semyonov has never denied his crimes and saw his every act as a necessary one to keep power and resist Red occupation of Siberia."
mo2.9.a:0 "This bodes poorly."
mo2.9.b:0 "This bodes well."

mo2.91.t:0 "Sentenced to Death"
mo2.91.d:0 "Naturally the trial was short, Semyonov's victims and opponents in the court swiftly sent down the sentence. Death. When presented with the options for his demise Semyonov elected to be shot by firing squad - a soldier's death - he said. He shall get his wish."
mo2.91.a:0 "Good Riddance."
#mo2.91.b:0 ""

mo2.92.t:0 "Sentenced to Prison"
mo2.92.d:0 "Rather than stoop to the lows of the Ataman the court has decided to find a nice cage for Semyonov and lock him in there. A life sentence for his crimes seems almost too kind for him, yet to simply kill him would be meeting barbarism with barbarism. The dilema will likely be chewed on long after he has succumbed to his prison."
mo2.92.a:0 "I hope he rots."
#mo2.92.b:0 ""

mo2.10.t:0 "Talks with Harbin"
mo2.10.d:0 "While Zheltorossiya was Semyonov’s sworn enemy, the same cannot be said for the new Republican leaders. There are still strong connections among the former Kadets in many parts of the former Empire. We can use these connections to establish economic ties with Zheltorossiya."
mo2.10.a:0 "Hopefully they see the mutual benefit to be had."
mo2.10.b:0 "Hopefully we will form a united front to the Tsarists"

mo2.11.t:0 "First Elections"
mo2.11.d:0 "The first elections of the post-Semyonov Transbaikal are about to be held, the expected winner is Kadet Liberal Sergei Taskin, his is opposed by Conservative Piritrim Sorokin. Whichever way the polls swing, Transbaikal is about to become a true Democratic Republic at last."
mo2.11.a:0 "Democracy of a kind."
mo2.11.b:0 "What we need is order."

mo2.12.t:0 "Taskin Wins"
mo2.12.d:0 "As anticipated Taskin has won a comfortable victory, he is now President and has pledged to move Transbaikal into a properous and free future. His opponent Piritrim Sorokin has graciously conceeded defeat and offered his service to the new government."
mo2.12.a:0 "We may yet set an example to all Russia."
#mo2.12.b:0 ""

mo2.13.t:0 "Sorokin's Conservatives Win"
mo2.13.d:0 "Against expectations Sorokin's more Conservative platform has won the day, perhaps some among Semyonov's supporters saw him as the lesser of the two evils. Sorokin's more modest programme of reform is still a strong breath of fresh air in Chita, and Taskin has offered his support to the new President saying - 'I wish him all the best in his endeavours, may he make our home strong'."
mo2.13.a:0 "Let's hope he can keep the Cossacks happy."
#mo2.13.b:0 ""

mo2.14.t:0 "The New Duma"
mo2.14.d:0 "The government is in dire need of reform and the first place to look would be the legislature, Semyonov’s dictatorship required no such trappings of statecraft and his inner circle operated out of his private residence. The new Transbaikal requires a formal Duma however, one that carries the spirit of 1919 and the Kadets forward."
mo2.14.a:0 "The Revolution may not have been a total waste."

mo2.15.t:0 "The Cossack Republic Declared"
mo2.15.d:0 "At long last the Cossack state has been realised, Cossacks from across the former Empire are called home, their new nation will provide and together they will shake off the Russian Yoke in Siberia."
mo2.15.a:0 "Long may it last."
#mo2.15.b:0 ""

mo2.16.t:0 "The Far-East Republic Declared"
mo2.16.d:0 "Unity with Zheltorossiya has created the unique situation of a rebirth of the Far-East Republic, a brief state that existed during the civil war before the ceasefire caused Semyonov to break Transbaikal away from Russia. It's rebirth represents a challenge to the rump Empire, a reminder of past hostilities and claims."
mo2.16.a:0 "Perhaps we should invite the Tsarists to visit?"
#mo2.16.b:0 ""

mo2.17.t:0 "Organising a Coup"
mo2.17.d:0 "In order to secure the future of the Russian Republic it must remove the threat posed by Zheltorossiya's Government, in their exile they seem to have leaned into their worst characters and taken a path that leads to ruin, we should correct their course with a coup of the leadership by moderate and liberal forces."
mo2.17.a:0 "Hopefully this won't backfire."
#mo2.17.b:0 ""

mo2.19.t:0 "Against all odds"
mo2.19.d:0 "The coup has been a resounding success! The Republican Guard were brought into the plan late in the game but proved a faithful asset, they seized the governemnt and arrested the radical leaders in short order. A state of emergency was declared and the Kadet's of Transbaikal were formally invited by a Zheltorossiya spokesman to take over the apparatus of governemnt."

mo2.171.t:0 "Unification with Transbaikal"
mo2.171.d:0 "The Kadets in Transbaikal have managed to infiltrate the Republican Guard and attempt a coup. The guards have quickly taken control of the government buildings and handed power to loyal Kadet Constitutionalist members. The last chance to stop the coup has come, the district commander of the guards has been informed of the ruse and has been asked to stand his men down. The commander has a telephone and two conflicting pieces of paper on his desk, one informing him of the President's arrest warrant on the authority of the Republican Government, the other informing him of a stand-down order on the authority of the Executive of the Republic. With the fate of teh Far-East in his hands, which shall he choose?"
mo2.171.a:0 "It is they who should join us."
mo2.171.b:0 "Slava Respublike!"

mo2.18.t:0 "Caught Red Handed!"
mo2.18.d:0 "The coup has failed! The Republican Guard has been compromised it seems, no longer loyal to the 1919 declaration but to ideologues instead, they ratted us out and our men on the inside have been arrested and executed. Zheltorossiyan troops are now mobilising near our border and an ultimatum to the Duma demanding our unification under threat of invasion has been sent."
mo2.18.a:0 "Blyad'..."
mo2.18.b:0 "We Fight!"

mo2.20.t:0 "Negotiate with Harbin"
mo2.20.d:0 "The moderate governemnt in Zheltorossiya could be persuaded to unify with us. Kerensky's rule has been marred by the famine and so if we intervene as a stabilising force the transition of power will be easy."
mo2.20.a:0 "We Must Stand Together"

mo2.21.t:0 "Plans for Zheltorossiya"
mo2.21.d:0 "Zheltorossiya must be united with us one way or another, we are the two true successors to the revolution and thus should form a united front against the Tsarists. Zheltorossiya has some political issues that may make such a unification impossible though diplomacy however..."

mo2.100.d:0 "In order to secure our western border we should begrudgingly ally ourselves to Sternberg, though we shall never truly trust him  he is a convenient ally that will allow us to focus on issues closer to home."
mo2.100.a:0 "An Uneasy Alliance"

mo2.101.t:0 "The Borderlands"
mo2.101.d:0 "Born out of Grigory Semyonov’s disillusionment with Kolchak’s government and his own personal interests - The Transbaikal Cossack Host broke off from the Kolchak regime on the 14th of July, 1925, spearheaded by the Cossack regiments under Semyonov’s personal command, what followed suit was a breakdown of order in the state, as Semyonov’s mad militarisation led to the creation of the “Armeyskiy Okrug”, or the Military District system reminiscent of Dutov’s Orenburg Military District far west - the idea of which being that every division of the army was responsible for maintaining a region. Unsurprisingly, order was replaced with rampant corruption, and all forms of law had broken down. Bandit lords from Mongolia, Manchuria and Russia began moving in, crime became commonplace, and even the Cossacks themselves began pillaging villages on the borders with other warlords. Semyonov did not give a single shred of attention to his people - living in luxury whilst contemplating his ambitions of a greater eastern Cossack state.\nBehind the scenes however, one of Semyonov’s underlings has started his campaign to bring back law and order to the host. That man’s name would be Sergey Taskin, the head of the so-called government of Chita, and while he may not really be in the public light, his actions of liberalising the state and reducing the power of the merciless Cossacks brought him support from all ends of the government - most notably those who fled Russia, one of which would be Pitrim Sorokrin, an economist with whom he would form a great partnership to bring democracy to the eastern bank of the lake Baikal. Under the New Kadet Party - Taskin sees a long journey to topple the dictator of Chita, however, even as more people take notice of the Ataman’s madness, he questions whether his actions can stem beyond the borders and perhaps change the Far-East forever."
mo2.101.a:0 "Outlaws Never Change."

mo2.102.t:0 "Change in Chita?"
mo2.102.d:0 "Soldiers on horseback, tachankas towed closely behind, crossed through the streets of the most populous military district of Chita early this morning.. Transbaikal had been well known in eastern Siberia as a truly lawless land, inhabited by bandit lords seeking refuge from China and Russia, of which have held a tight grip on the governing Cossack divisions responsible for maintaining order in Chita - at least on paper. As a head of the government of Transbaikal, Sergey Taskin hasn’t received much attention despite his supposedly high status and elite position, primarily due to his lack of power within the nation’s affairs due to it’s highly decentralised structure. However, some semblance of change has occurred for the first time since the declaration of the territory’s independence from Kolchak’s government as the 11th Cossack Regiment patrolled the streets of Chita from day to night. A quick chat with any member of the regiment reveals that Taskin had bought out the regiment from his personal wealth, which raises some suspicion due to his liberal ideas. However, the moral question is quickly overshadowed by the fact that today’s people of the city could finally sleep well at night without worries of burglary or pillaging."

Transbaikal_solvethepoverty_desc:0 "Semyonov’s foolish ideas of tributary states and other mad ideas have driven our people to the brink of famine. Luckily, the congress has stepped in and now immediate food supplies will begin being sent to the worst affected areas."
Transbaikal_cossackprotection:0 "Cossack Protection"
Transbaikal_cossackprotection_desc:0 "While Semyonov’s Cossack army have proven to be highly corrupt and disloyal to the new government, it would no doubt be a waste to not realign them to our cause. Their skills are after all invaluable with our neighbours running rampant."
Transbaikal_siberiandespot:0 "Siberian Despot"
Transbaikal_siberiandespot_desc:0 "None shall stand in the way of the Ataman - not even his own chief staff. A personal guard shall be made in Semyonov’s defense, the power of the high command shall be reduced and every soldier must pledge an oath of loyalty."
Transbaikal_economyofviolence:0 "Economy of Violence"
Transbaikal_economyofviolence_desc:0 "While our Cossacks are infamous for pillaging villages throughout Mongolia and even some border villages in Zheltorossiya, we haven’t fully utilised their capabilities. We should start demanding tribute from villages and towns in exchange for “protection” against whatever our imagination can come up with."
Transbaikal_alignthemongolchiefs:0 "Align the Mongol Princes"
Transbaikal_alignthemongolchiefs_desc:0 "Similarly to Sternberg’s ruthless appeasement to the princes, we should follow suit if we want to guarantee elite support during our planned conquest of the Mongol steppes."
Transbaikal_screwkolchak:0 "To Hell With Kolchak!"
Transbaikal_screwkolchak_desc:0 "The bastard from Moscow had backstabbed us with high taxes, direct rule from the Russian military and direct control of the railway. Semyonov had none of it, and decided to break away with his warlord state. We will never back down to the Russian dog - for Chita is and will forever be its own nation of Russians and Buryats!"
Transbaikal_sellrussianlabour:0 "Penal Labour"
Transbaikal_sellrussianlabour_desc:0 "The traitors of the state shall be reprimanded to our people’s full benefit. Parks, bridges, homes - they will be all built through hard labour by the bastards who questioned the will of our leader."
Transbaikal_talkswithharbin:0 "Talks with Harbin"
Transbaikal_talkswithharbin_desc:0 "We’re one of the few democracies in eastern Siberia, and Zheltorossiya is our only amicable neighbour. We must develop closer ties to our large neighbour if we want to further improve relations and promote democracy throughout eastern Russia."
Transbaikal_educationprograms:0 "Education Programs"
Transbaikal_educationprograms_desc:0 "A scene resembling that of the 18th - very little of our population is actually literate. If we want to industrialise, we have to open several engineering schools and teach people to read and write."
Transbaikal_abolishthemilitarydistricts:0 "Abolish the Military Districts"
Transbaikal_abolishthemilitarydistricts_desc:0 "A clear scar from the times of Semyonov - the military district has left local governments highly corrupt and prone to instability. Now is the time for the people to take over."
Transbaikal_firstelections:0 "First Elections"
Transbaikal_firstelections_desc:0 "And as such, a true democracy must call upon democracy. Now is the end of the temporary government, leading to the fierce political battle between economist Pitrim Sorokrin and Sergei Taskin for the premier of Transbaikal. Who will rule the republic onwards?"
Transbaikal_statewithanarmy:0 "State with an Army"
Transbaikal_statewithanarmy_desc:0 "The line between our country and the army has been blurred recently with our drastic and much needed reforms. The final nail in the coffin for Semyonov’s junta shall officially separate state and the army, and end all manner of military rule in the government."
Transbaikal_russiandemocracy:0 "Russian Democracy"
Transbaikal_russiandemocracy_desc:0 "What Kerensky failed to achieve in Moscow has come true on the Baikal river, as our citizens have begun enjoying the luxuries of free speech, egalitarianism and other liberties - free of the fear that the military may bash down their door over their opinion."
Transbaikal_districtmilitias:0 "District Militias"
Transbaikal_districtmilitias_desc:0 "We can’t solely rely on the Cossacks, after all, what happens an enemy force marches in on our northern fronts? A simple solution would be to establish District Militias, made up of conscripted peasants and armed with cheap weaponry to serve as distractions while the brunt of our army focuses on offense."
Transbaikal_therailwayassociation:0 "The Railway Association"
Transbaikal_therailwayassociation_desc:0 "A clique within the government led by Taskin may be striving for political discourse and reform, but at the same time, they’re the sole authority responsible for our portion of the Siberian railway - and are responsible for a large part of our industry.\nPerhaps a deal with them may push things to our benefit."
Transbaikal_localblackhundredschapter:0 "Local Black Hundreds Chapter"
Transbaikal_localblackhundredschapter_desc:0 "Though no doubt our Cossacks are feared amongst our foes, we could always diversify our arsenal. Kolchak’s regime is corrupt to the core, and it wouldn’t take too much effort to sway some troops from the west to join our ranks with some incentive."
Transbaikal_allforataman:0 "All for Ataman"
Transbaikal_allforataman_desc:0 "We shall not fall under the illusion of a stable democracy - Zheltorossiya is a great example of the failed system, and even if we did decentralise our power, the Cossacks’ authority would be blatantly undermined. Semyonov has declared himself Ataman and arrested Taskin leaving nothing internally to challenge his rule."
Transbaikal_manofthepeople:0 "Man of the People"
Transbaikal_manofthepeople_desc:0 "Semyonov’s careless decision of allowing the assembly in Chita to take place had quickly led to his downfall in a bloodless coup that resulted in the madman being arrested, and the government being taken over by NKD - essentially ending the stratocracy that is Transbaikal. Taskin now stands before the Cossacks and his people as the new ruler of the nation."
Transbaikal_solvethecorruption:0 "Solve the Corruption"
Transbaikal_solvethecorruption_desc:0 "The Cossack Army is filled with officers and soldiers from Kolchak’s far-eastern Army who defected for their own interests, and now they are wreaking havoc on the already poor population with extortion, intimidation and other criminalities. This has to stop."
Transbaikal_fatherlandforall:0 "Fatherland for All"
Transbaikal_fatherlandforall_desc:0 "Even with the perils that came with the takeover of the government, we managed to prevail in restoring Chita to its former glory. The government is no longer disorganised, the people are no longer starving and most importantly - we’re all united under democracy."
Transbaikal_theswissmodel:0 "The Swiss Model"
Transbaikal_theswissmodel_desc:0 "Switzerland is famous for it’s dastard neutrality in every major concept since Napoleon. Their model of avoiding conflict may very well serve as an inspiration to our nation - we are sandwiched between the Chinese, the Russians and the Japanese. Why should we involve ourselves in petty wars when we can focus on our own nation?"
Transbaikal_formthefareastrepublic:0 "Form the Far-East Republic"
Transbaikal_formthefareastrepublic_desc:0 "Our efforts have pulled through - our nations have come together, and now our dreams of restoring a democratic Russia are closing in to reality. Now, all we have to do is sign this piece of paper…"
Transbaikal_negotiatewithharbin:0 "Negotiate with Harbin"
Transbaikal_negotiatewithharbin_desc:0 "A union is no easy undertaking - we will have to adjust local governing systems, merge the military, use the same rail gauges and so on. It would be best to head to Harbin itself to discuss this perilous task with our brethren."
Transbaikal_anindependentrepublic:0 "An Independent Republic"
Transbaikal_anindependentrepublic_desc:0 "Initially, our hopes of forming a true democratic successor to Kolchak’s empire were main on our agenda, however - they did not fall through. Zheltorossiya has fallen to the authoritarianism it once swore to shatter, and now we stand alone. We must prevail."
Transbaikal_pacificties:0 "Pacific Ties"
Transbaikal_pacificties_desc:0 "We’ve become an isolated republic after breaking ties with Zheltorossiya, which has spelled some economic problems for our people. We shall remedy this by establishing ties with numerous nations throughout the Pacific and in China."
Transbaikal_anewidentity:0 "A New Identity"
Transbaikal_anewidentity_desc:0 "Kolchak’s regime falling under Chita’s jurisdiction is a bigger unrealisable dream than recreating Rome itself. Thus, we must adapt, and form our own identity to combat any remaining influence from Moscow, and to reinforce our patriotism and ideals."
Transbaikal_organiseacoup:0 "Organise a Coup"
Transbaikal_organiseacoup_desc:0 "Sadly, Zheltorossiya doesn’t share the same sentiment with us, and has decided to pursue a path of regionalism and authoritarianism. Perhaps a “small nudge” will push them to our side?"
Transbaikal_planswithzheltorossiya:0 "Plans with Zheltorossiya"
Transbaikal_planswithzheltorossiya_desc:0 "Looks like our plans fell through. Our ambitions of forming a true far-eastern democracy are closer than ever - our people will be united in hopes of finally liberating Russia from the Kolchakist reactionaries once and for all!"
Transbaikal_fundtheschools:0 "Fund the Schools"
Transbaikal_fundtheschools_desc:0 "The majority of our great thinkers are descendants of the Decembrist Revolt from over a hundred years ago. We shall spiral a new age of innovation amongst our youth by establishing an official education system, erecting a proper university in our capital and funding literacy initiatives through the countryside."
Transbaikal_crushthebandits:0 "Crush the Bandits"
Transbaikal_crushthebandits_desc:0 "The inevitable moment to destroy the anarchy in our nation has finally arrived. Our troops stand organised, and ready to put an end to the robber barons, mob bosses and lowlifes that have mercilessly harassed our people."
Transbaikal_aircraftpurchases:0 "Aircraft Purchases"
Transbaikal_aircraftpurchases_desc:0 "The Zheltorossiyans and the Japanese have always proved to be pioneers of engineering, and to not mutually reap the benefits of aeronautics would spell disaster for our fight against our foes if we hadn’t achieved proper recon capabilities."
Transbaikal_rejuvinatethecities:0 "Rejuvinate the Cities"
Transbaikal_rejuvinatethecities_desc:0 "We cannot neglect our urban centres either. Many districts in Chita don’t even have roads or proper power grids. First, we shall address the infrastructural problems, then begin reimagining the city by constructing a parliament, new social services and a proper city hall."
Transbaikal_beginindustrialisation:0 "Begin Industrialisation"
Transbaikal_beginindustrialisation_desc:0 "The industrial revolution - while late - has finally arrived in Transbaikal. We have such a potential with the Trans-Siberian railway in our midst, and such an innovative populace filled with engineers who have chosen to escape from Russia to join our ranks and at last, we shall put them to work."
Transbaikal_expandtherailway:0 "Expand the Railway"
Transbaikal_expandtherailway_desc:0 "The great railway runs through Chita itself and is the powerhouse of our economy, being used as a crucial stop for travellers until they reach Zheltorossiya. Yet, the northern parts of Baikalia enjoy none of the benefits of infrastructure that the railway holds. It’s about time we branch out the railway."
Transbaikal_fareasttradingcompany:0 "Far-East Trading Company"
Transbaikal_fareasttradingcompany_desc:0 "Being an isolated country bears no good news for a developing economy such as ours. By establishing a formal trading company under the guidance of the Railway Association - we can formalise our ties with other nations along the Siberian railway, and establish a proper trade network."
Transbaikal_electrification:0 "Electrification"
Transbaikal_electrification_desc:0 "Many in Russia consider Benjamin Franklin’s invention a luxury or have downright never heard of such a concept as electricity. We can be the envy of Siberia after all, as using power plants supplied by the coal mines in the area, and finally bring light to the wooden shacks that sprinkle our countryside."
Transbaikal_andcharge:0 "And Charge!"
Transbaikal_andcharge_desc:0 "The strength and fighting prowess of the Cossacks shall be told in legends, even as far as the west. Our brutality would scare entire divisions, and it would take over a hundred troops to take down a single of our cavalrymen."
Transbaikal_wintersoldiers:0 "Winter Soldiers"
Transbaikal_wintersoldiers_desc:0 "However, the brunt of our army should be up and against Russia - meaning most of our future battles would be in the Siberian tundra - in temperatures as low as 50°C. Proper insulation, winter tracks and generous amounts of warm food will mean our victory against Moscow’s tyrants."
Transbaikal_machineandmaneuver:0 "Machine and Maneuver"
Transbaikal_machineandmaneuver_desc:0 "The Steppes and Siberia are highly isolated places, some villages may be thousands of kilometers apart, and in between being harsh conditions and poor infrastructure. Loading our troops up in proper trucks supported by tankettes will mean that no matter the distance - we will reach our targets."
Transbaikal_northernterror:0 "Northern Terror"
Transbaikal_northernterror_desc:0 "The people will learn to fear what our troops are truly capable of. It doesn't matter wherever they are skirmishers or infantry, our Cossacks will always be seen as ruthless and relentless soldiers who jingoistically fight to the very end, no matter the consenquences."
Transbaikal_readyforsiberia:0 "Ready for Siberia"
Transbaikal_readyforsiberia_desc:0 "Just as the Cossacks colonised Siberia, so will we pioneer modern combat in the great Far-East. Our men shall trawl through the frozen mud, toil through the snow and graze through winter storms and be left with not even a scratch."
Transbaikal_readythecossacks:0 "Ready the Cossacks"
Transbaikal_readythecossacks_desc:0 "Our latest venture in Mongolia has granted our deserved fame - we are the bogeymen of the north, at least according to the peasants in rural Northern China. it would be absolutely foolish to not push our infamy to the absolute limits."
Transbaikal_modernisetheagriculture:0 "Modernise the Agriculture"
Transbaikal_modernisetheagriculture_desc:0 "Undoubtedly, the invention of the tractor and new farming techniques has revolutionised farming and it should be no different to the people that live outside Chita, who would only have children to serve as labour on their plots. The day of change has come."
Transbaikal_hunterregiments:0 "Hunter Regiments"
Transbaikal_hunterregiments_desc:0 "Regardless of how much food we hurl on our trucks, we will eventually run out of food as our supply lines stretch outwards from our capital. An old, yet simple solution is to make our troops supply themselves - hunting their own meat, foraging their own berries - anything goes as long as it can be made into soup."
