CAL.1.title:0 "Oh How Far The Mighty Have Fallen"
CAL.1.desc:0 "Welcome to California - Regardless of how you've arrived here, America Has Collasped. Nothing else except our fair nation quite matters anymore - from the Sea we came, and to the Shining Sea we arrived. We, the heirs of Jamestown, have finally arrived to the logical conclusion of the American Experiment; Death. \n\n And so, we must pick up the pieces and try to continue living, even if it requires scraping by in poverty. People in the streets are dying, the Riverside Council is trying it's best to maintain order as resources get badly allocated, and chaos in general ensues, but there is also a patriotic profoundity in this new Experiment being birthed from the American Experiment. Perhaps good things will come from this."
CAL.1.a:0 "Perhaps this is Our Future."
CAL.2.title:0 "You're in for a Scare!"
CAL.2.desc:0 "From his apartment Bodin watched the sunset engulf the innocent of California, as the monsters realm beckoned out. As the signs of Light vanquished slowly he could already feel the evil presence of demonry and ungodliness arrive within the air. All around the world was the spirit of evil fermenting, zombie, ghosts, extra-terrestrials, and of course the flaws of mortal men, all to come out after the sun. For hours he watched out his window as the world went into black. He tried to get himself to shut out the world after that, to blissfully go into the realm of fantasy, but the problem kept gnawing at him, and he was forced to reside within the domain of the paranormal until God sent the sun back. But he figured that it was all but pointless to fight this struggle alone, so he turned on KCW, one of his favorite broadcasting stations to help give some comfort within this blackness. But the contents proved that the darkness had infested much more then his limited physical vision. Horror stories came on the air as the situation in the East was revealed to be radiply deteriorating, and that civil war was immenent. 'Of course' he muttered silently to himself, 'the darkness comes earlier in the East'. The announcment filled him with dread, but also something else, something he hadn't expected; hope. He knew that eventually the darkness would end but... if it could be expediented wouldn't that just be better for the world? 'Enlightenment' is what they called it, the torch... YES! He realized, and immediatley rang up the quite frightened operator and with the excitment of a goal of an eternity finally coming into reach he asked;"
CAL.2.a:0 "Operator? Put me in to Alan Frost!"
CAL.3.title:0 "Olson's Pipe Dream"
CAL.3.desc:0 "Olson could hardly bear the thought, the east was done, he knew that. The Anarchists had done their part, the Military was revolting, the situation was basically done. But that's not what he had to do today, no? No today he had to go to yet another conference for his election campaign. What election? The radicals were never going to play by the rules, everyone knew that, no he should be trying to preserve the insititutions that built this state and Union insteading of pretending that everything was all fine. Cursing himself for being such a Politican he drove up to that damn office, but when he opened the door he was certainly not expecting a dizzying set of reporters asking his opinion on the whole matter and how it would affect California. 'You want my opnion on the current situation? Well, there is really only one thing to say. We are going to stand through this, you know why? Because we've got brains, brawn, and kindness to do so, and we're not ready to kill eachother over such trivial things. We cannot allow ourselves to fall like everyone else has, because if not us, then who?"
CAL.3.a:0 "You didn't answer me."
CAL.4.title:0 "Okay, this is EPIC;"
CAL.4.desc:0 "What a nice day Sinclair thought. The birds were singing the rain gave the grass a nice glow, and a nice moderate temperature kept the scenery not too humid. Shame that the nation was falling apart. After breakfast Sinclair took his daily stroll, and he could only shudder as the sights continued to stay right there in his face. Children living in Mellontowns, needles all over the ground, beggars all abounded. What little change he had he was sure to give off, for only the most callous could see such a sight and not give to their common man. As he came up to the local cafe for a bit more stimulus for his sure to be exhausting day, he saw something that shocked him to his very core, a sign with his name on it, and picture too! Filled with insult and wrath he departed the cafe for his office at once, he had been very adament to his manager that he was not to have advertisments and oh boy was he going to feel the scorn of such a betrayl. While entering his office he did not enter with usual optimistic attitude or even his friendly wave to his secretary, no he marched right into the managers office to demand an explanation. After a few heated moments of heated yelling the Manager was finally able to explain himself to the aging author. It was not, he defended, his original intention to do such a thing and he had especially regretting not telling Sinclair his ambitions, but, he reasoned, Sinclair could simply not keep the role of the humble wise man if he wished to become the Governor of California, it simply could not happen. Olson owned the established press and whatever small publications were pro Bodin, 'the vagabonds champion' afterall. So, he defended, he had no option but to engage in traditional campaign tactics if Sinclair even had a chance. 'Alright' Sinclair grumbled. EPIC had to be done, and, well; \n\n It can't happen 'if' I'm governor." 
CAL.4.a:0 "It can only take place if I 'am'."
CAL.9.title:0 "The False Idea of Jefferson"
CAL.9.desc:0 "Jefferson is a joke of a nation above us - it barely holds on to it's mountain realm, hiding in pillow forts with toy guns as their soldiers of tin whine about rural autonomies, something we'd be willing to discuss if they weren't so uppity. Now, it is time to strike - it is time to do something about these separatists weakening our beloved California, our Golden Nation, our Allegro, our beauty! We will stop them at all costs if we are to get precious rural land and mountains back, for harvesting of water, of resources, of grain! We need these resources or our people will dwindle! Regardless - it would give the Riverside Council that needed push of legitimacy."
CAL.9.a:0 "Prepare the war plans."
CAL.28.title:0 "Between Holy Spirits"
CAL.28.desc:0 "The very Reincarnation of Jean Bodin had been sitting right in front of the young L Ron Hubbard, two mystics and Holy Spirits, which had been awakened and dragged from obscurity and relative quiet life to total power by the enlightenment of the White Californian, who understood that along with their need for self-survival as a separate Western nation distinct from all others and completely independently-functioning, one that is able to project itself on the World Stage and subsequently express that Holy sense of ethnicity and Race into less fortunate areas, and like so the two mystics thought quietly on top of a mountain in the hot Sierra Nevada desert - the great place of Challenge for the Pioneers of the Race, of the Hyperborean, the places of great enlightenment. Wearing nothing but white robes that reflected the Sun's light and lit off rainbows against the sky. The wind gently touched their bodies and they removed their glasses, hats, and all other accessories, only feeling their long hairs against the wind as their spirits went into Astral Projection - and from then on, they met the Hyperborean world, where the original Alien Pre-Humans had come from, and then a vision of horror of the many Teegeeack which began invading the Earth. Subsequently, in this holy realm beyond Thrace, they looked around and saw constellations, galaxies, and other gorgeous planets. \n\n And then, Bodin told Hubbard; \"My child, we are not from this World; we are beyond Human, in fact, as Humanity entails Teegeeack-ness, and Ape-likeness. It is nescessary, that to reach Enlightenment, one must transcend beyond their Humanity, and live free. The Hyperboreans live in constant conflict with outside forces, be they Thetans or be they Ape. We must rise beyond the Human label and become Galactic: To become the Sixth Root Race; the culmination of all Anglo-Saxon expressions in California.\""
CAL.28.a:0 "The Desert is where God lives."
CAL.35.title:0 "Protestantism is Above Christianity"
CAL.35.desc:0 "The Reincarnation of Jean Bodin thought about the development of the American Experiment and the beauty of it as a beacon of Holy Protestantism, and how subsequently it fell to chaos and death - how the largest Protestant country in the World died at the hands of Anarchists, and yet the Protestants undyingly labor every single day to protect individual freedom, individual expression, and the rights protected by Capitalism, the sacred ideas of Protestantism - like it's work ethic, the Blue Laws, all these things which in any other world would not exist outside of Nordic countries, an increasingly endangered final example of Hyperborean civilization. Sadly, California is the one to hold the Scepter and move forward - as the rest of America falls to ungood Papism and vile Atheism, as a great sea of Red Socialism destroys what centuries of Protestant culture and ethics allowed to exist. Russia, for example, considered Sacred by many Eastern Europeans, lives as the largest Orthodox country in the world, and yet it is at the seams of death. It seems that every opposition to Catholics and Socialists is dying, and one final stand must be done - and that is the most radical choice possible - put Protestantism above Christianity itself. \n\n Perhaps it is mistaken to think of the Protestant culture as only Christian, instead of being possible as compatible with new religious movements which spring up everyday in our Holy California by virtue of said Protesstant Culture. Perhaps it is high time that Protestantism splits off from Christianity completely."
CAL.35.a:0 "To save something, you must cut what hurts."
CAL.46.title:0 "EXCALIBUR!"
CAL.46.desc:0 "L Ron Hubbard's masterpiece had been finished long ago, that is true... but it's ideas weren't finished into a single, coherent concept (and book) yet. One of the ideas presented, called Dianetics, was presented as a way to remove the Thetans which plague the singular soul of a person and give them various ailments. People suffer immensely without L Ron Hubbard's knowledge, and with his immense benevolence, he has decided to make an entire book on Dianetics freely available to be distributed across California as an introductory piece to the party line regarding spirituality. Regardless, the ideas within Excalibur, the more obscure and \"forbidden\" book to \"lower OT level\" audiences, itself are downright pagan; there is nothing in them that talks about Christ or God, and instead focus moreso on direct situations of spirituality that can be adressed and cared for, such as the Thetans, and the whole situation regarding the origin of Humanity, which L Ron Hubbard believes is of the story of the Galactic Confederacy, where their Dictator, Xenu, had brought billions of Teegeeack to Earth and subsequently stacked them around Volcanoes, then killed them with enormous bombs of unimagined, alien scale. The thetans, or immortal spirits of these creatures attach to humans and create several ailments and diseases, such as anxiety, panic disorder, schizophrenia, etcetera. These ideas are incredibly esoteric and most people are not ready for it yet, but the Hollywood aristocracy has long shared them around since even before California became independent, and we shall begin slowly filtering people into understanding the truth of Humanity's origins, step by step."
CAL.46.a:0 "Soon, all of California will know."
#FOCUSES#
CAL_californiadreamin:0 "California Dreaming"
CAL_californiadreamin_desc:0 "With the current crisis engulfing the nation and our populace at the end of their rope, one option has become clear, we must not subject our citizenry to the horrors that are going on out East. While the rest of America burns, California will become a safe haven for all of her tired and poor, and so California will dream of a better future."
CAL_theneutrallocation:0 "The Neutral Location"
CAL_theneutrallocation_desc:0 "After an extremely wise decision by the local authorities, it was decided that the Californian state authorities would convene in Riverside, a relatively small city with no political connections that doesn't have a Hispanic name, avoiding the ire of conservatives and liberals alike as we determine the future of California in our beloved Riverside."
CAL_preperationforelection:0 "Election Preperations"
CAL_preperationforelection_desc:0 "With the nation in chaos following the lack of an elected offical to lead our nation, we are in need of a government. As such, staying true to the Democratic principles of America we shall hold an election. Of course, what with only God knows radicals and violence abounding our streets special... precautions will have to be taken to ensure that the process and system runs smoothly, however it is paramount that we uphold these principles."
CAL_reclaimjefferson:0 "Reclaim Jefferson"
CAL_reclaimjefferson_desc:0 "With the total collapse of serious governmental authority, both Federal and State, the people of Northern California have in quite a shocking manner declared secession from our great state! Obviously since this cannot stand we must return the rule of law to this, via recent troubling reports, lawless and archaic land. Our states borders are clearly defined and if we wish to preserve stability we must keep our borders secure until this crisis ends."
CAL_prepareagainstmormonmachinations:0 "Prepare against Mormon Machinations"
CAL_prepareagainstmormonmachinations_desc:0 "For almost one hundred years the good people of the American West have been subject to the fundamentalist polygamists known as the Mormons. For far too long they have been able to rein supreme in the West with their border line Pagan religon. With ever more increasing reports of border conflicts in Nevada taking place after the illegal seizure of Reno by the so-proclaimed 'Deseret' authority, and as much as we'd prefer to crush their Deseret experiment, we must deal with our internal problems first, and subsequently we will have to defend ourselves in case of further attacks by the 'Deseret' authority."
CAL_electionday:0 "Election Day!"
CAL_electionday_desc:0 "It is finally time! With the campaigns finally complete the ballot counting has begun! With a hotly contested race between Avant-Guarde Radical Edward Bodin, Status-Quo pro American Candidate Frank Merriam, and avowed Socialist and popular author Upton Sinclair this is sure to be a nail biter unseen in Californian State History! With the final ballots being counted the radio is expected to give the results any minute..."
CAL_scareme:0 "Scare Me!"
CAL_scareme_desc:0 "The spirits of California quake in both fear and awe as the acclaimed science fiction author Edward L. Bodin takes the reins of California! An expert on all things aesthetic, philisophical, and paranormal, the critically acclaimed author and descendant of the great Jean Bodin, takes his place as the Governor of California! Vowing to remove all anti-American 'actors' from this land, the future bodes as California follows the path of the Blinding Future!"
CAL_theplotsagainstamerica:0 "The Plots Against America"
CAL_theplotsagainstamerica_desc:0 "It has become immediately clear that America fell to several conspirators, which our great President of the Californian Republic has proclaimed as being the Catholics, Anarchists, Capitalists, and Socialists which plagued this country for decades and stayed hidden within this country's government and society. Now, they revealed their ugly rear and destroyed America while doing so - and like that, we must move on from said experiment in the name of a great future, yet with America's message in mind."
CAL_warplansword:0 "War Plan Sword"
CAL_warplansword_desc:0 "When our great Anglo-Saxon ancestors were fighting a battle to the death with the accursed paranormals of the old country they used something seemingly amif to the modern day; the great Sword of Damocles. Just as St. George of old, let us take up this mantle and declare unto the traitors to the American people and plunge it right into the heart of the asiatic menace that has since come to take away California and America, into Hawaii we go to kill the Asiatic Serpent once more!"
CAL_colonizehawaii:0 "Colonize Hawaii"
CAL_colonizehawaii_desc:0 "With the great beast slain let us now take upon our burden to civilize these asiatic hordes that have been taken by our brave knights of California! The American People shall rest easy knowing that the paranormals Asiatic barbarians have been expulged from the Pacific rim and sent back to the pigmy jungles where they belong!"
CAL_investigationsintothespiritual:0 "Investigations into the Spiritual"
CAL_investigationsintothespiritual_desc:0 "As any man knows there is an other worldly realm from our own. This 'realm of spirits' is almost as real as the land that we walk upon, and yet despite that it seems that almost no one has bothered to look upon it! This must change at once! With the help of individuals talented in this... craft including our very Bodin we will connect with these souls of another realm and discover more and more about our world so that we may ever more thrust into the future! Onwards men, to the gates of the spirit and thus of Knowledge!"
CAL_protestantmystalica:0 "Protestant Mysticalia"
CAL_protestantmystalica_desc:0 "It should come as no shock to any Anglo-Saxon man that we are not the first of our race to come to seek such answers when involving the spiritual and paranormal! Through our research we have come accross hundreds if not thousands of supposedly 'occult' texts that seem to offer far more insight into the expieriences of our forebears when dealing with the paranormal. This begs the question then, WHY HASN'T ANYTHING BEEN DONE ABOUT IT? And to any learned man the answer is obvious, THE ANTI AMERICAN 'ACTORS' HAVE POLLUTED THE CONVERSATION! They have done their best for their paranormal overlords in trying to keep the common man away from the truth but now he shall rue the day that he sought to contain such knowledge! A complete and total overhaul of Christianity within our society must be done, and the endless influence of those who would try to stiffle us shall banned in a new age of Protestant Mystalica!"
CAL_beyondchristianity:0 "Beyond Christianity"
CAL_beyondchristianity_desc:0 "Through our many months of intense study our finest philosophers have discovered the truth on Christ. Christ did not come as a dove, he came as a Sword! It was He alone who was sent by the Heavenly Father in order to extinguishe the forces of the paranormal and win the eternal war against Satan, and, unfortunately, he failed. The demons still live on, and no matter how hard our Warrior fought it wasn't enough. But that's not what our supposed 'Holy Men' wish to teach now is it? No, they want us to believe that Christ already won and that any resistence would be madness, BUT THEY ARE WRONG! Just because Christ failed does not mean that we will! Led by our new Messiah Edward Bodin we will pick up where he left off and will not rest until THE ETERNAL WAR OF DEMON VS GOD IS WON ONCE AND FOR ALL!"
CAL_cinemasetfree:0 "Cinema Set Free"
CAL_cinemasetfree_desc:0 "There are many within our great Nation who believe that we are nothing more then fanatic Reactionaries beset on extinguising the almost Promethian light that California has had on the world. This is simply not the case! We love California just as any good man, and we seek to drive her as the new torch of Enlightenment for the World! And how shall this be accomplished? Cinema! Just as our comrades in France have unleashed the potential of the cinema in showing the world the true path, so must we show the world learn about the real nature of the worlds; and Hollywood is the place to start! Though of course all anti-American forces will have to be merticulusly cut from the cloth before we start, once it is finished, the 'movie' industry as it now being called will blossom into a blinding light that the world cannot help but look in awe!"
CAL_awakentheworld:0 "Awaken the World"
CAL_awakentheworld_desc:0 "The World has seen tough times, through those who wish to crush it untold millions have been led into eternal night, taken in by both the false promieses of Capital and the eternal Red Siren. But the darkest night comes before dawn! With Hollywood cinema now shown from Lisbon to Beijing, something quite beautiful has happened; the world seems to be waking up! Already our great Governor-Messiah Bodin has recieved hundreds of thousands of letters proclaiming that people are listening to the Truth! Every thing is going to plan, and a new Dawn is coming!"
CAL_endpapism:0 "End Papism"
CAL_endpapism_desc:0 "Through all our efforts we have found the enemy that our forebears contantly warned of but we were too blinded by pride to notice, THE PAPISTS! By far the biggest resistence to Enlightentment around the world has been the eternal papist dogs that seek to end our gaining of the Truth! So, let us end them in a true showing of Anglo-Saxon spirit, and MARCH AGAINST THEM! All accross California the Cathedrals will be closed, the indoctrination centers shut down forever, and an entire generation freed from the shackles of Rome! But we would twice the fool if we just assumed that simply not allowing them to come into the open would end them, no no no, the Papists have corrupted too much and have indirectly stolen too many innocent Anglo-Saxon Spirits, from the half-Papist Calvinists to the Lutherans they all must be brought to the end of their demonic ways in order for the Truth to prevail!"
CAL_investigationsintothephysical:0 "Investigations into the Physical"
CAL_investigationsintothephysical_desc:0 "Contrary to the un ending lies of the empiracists and their lackeys, there is another layer of reality; the paranormal. This paranormal reality is the undying world of the mind, one that only beings of a certain level of development are able to capture. This other level of reality is supieror to the level that most of us are aware of, for it can change the physical reality. Thanks to the incredible work done by our Governor we have been able to deduce that in fact our minds can manipulate reality around us in a sort of 'force' and even leave the physical reality and go entirely into the paranormal one. Throughout the centuries this has been interperated as a superstitous world after death but with Modern Technoledgy we can truly for the first time in Human history begin expierimenting with this new reality(s?)!"
CAL_harnessthepoweroftheparanormal:0 "Harness the Power of the Paranormal"
CAL_harnessthepoweroftheparanormal_desc:0 "Thanks to the tireless expierimentation of our brave Philosophers we have finally done it, the other realities beckon towards us! We have finally managed to go beyond matter and the material into the paranormal and now we must cherish and use it to our advantage! With the ability to move matter itself our armies will be unstopable as the rest of the world is awakened to these incredible discoveries!"
CAL_seizebigbussiness:0 "Seize Big Business"
CAL_seizebigbussiness_desc:0 "Empiricism, no matter how much we might try to combat it, has found a friend in the previously Holy American Economy, THROUGH THE ROBBER BARON! These parasites upon our society seek nothing more then to undo all of our tireless efforts at enlightentment for a few simple bucks! This cannot be allowed to continue and the economy shall be reorganized into a much more pro-Anglo-Saxon system that is perfectly tailored to the needs of our being."
CAL_californianfreedom:0 "Californian Freedom"
CAL_californianfreedom_desc:0 "California beckons for the enemies are soon to be extinguished! For the first time in the history of the world in nearly three centuries the world is finally coming out of the dark and California is the to be the great lamp for anyone who wishes to come to the Golden Door! As millions send their wishes to our revolution it is time for us to call upon the world and to no longer be behelden to the Papist, Empiracist, and Demonic influences of the East, for Englightenment follows the sun!"

For the Revolution of the Enlightenment waits for no one!"
CAL_thebellline:0 "The Bell Line"
CAL_thebellline_desc:0 "There is one final truth that we must share with our populace, we are not the only ones to acheive enlightenment! For there are other beings accross the great expanse of the cosmos who have managed to discover the same things we have, and they call out to us! In fact, we have reports of them engaging in increasing activity around our skies in ways of meteors, lights, and even flying aeroplanes! We must call out to them and communicate via the Spirt that we have achieved enlightentment too!"

After years of preparting for the great confrontation it is now time for America to become liberated from the darkness of the Papists, Empiracists, and the Demons and finally bring her into the light!
