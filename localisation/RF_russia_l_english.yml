KOLCHAK_RUSSIAN_DESC:0 "The Murder of Nicholas II in Kiev stirred up Russia. The government of confidence led by Prime Minister Stolypin stabilized the country and withstood the second Patriotic War. But the war broke the spirit of the Russian people. The socialists along with the traitorous liberals plunged the country into turmoil. The collapse of the country was stopped through the efforts of the officers and people who remained faithful to the oath. A decade has now passed and Russia has recovered. Alexander Kolchak holds the steering wheel firmly but the clouds thickened over Russia. Will the admiral withstand the coming flood or will the stream blow Russia to the rocks?"

#EVENT
russia.1.t:0 "Planning for a Vacation"
russia.1.d:0 "Finally I have finished most of my businesses at hand and have plenty of time to enjoy a vacation! I shall go to one of my properties away from Petrograd to relax myself from the cutthroat politics and gloomy weather here.There are several relaxing places I can visit on my vacation. All of them are different compared to Petrograd, but a somewhat closer destination might mean a safer journey...perhaps? "
russia.1.a:0 "I will go to Yalta to enjoy some sunshine!"
russia.1.b:0 "Went to Yalta last year, go to Novossiysk instead."
russia.1.c:0 "Can't go too far as I still have jobs to do. Lipava is fine."
russia.2.t:0 "The Prince of Darkness"
russia.2.d:0 "Today, the famous writer Mikhail Bulgakov published a novel titled "The Prince of Darkness", work that he considers to be his greatest achievement.\nThe book, while having several subplots such as Jesus Christ being rejected by Jews and the struggle of a talented avantguarde poet against a conservative artist elite, is mostly known for strange element of the Devil-Woland showing up in Moscow. At first shown as all powerful evil entity, Woland is quicky locked up by corrupt police officers and later tortured by Okhrana. Once relased on the streets of Moscow, Woland is facing series of misfortunes caused mainly by the old tsarist administration. After several days in Moscow, Woland declares that even Hell is better and returns, saying Moscow doesn't need the devil so long as Kolchak is there."
russia.2.a:0 "Horrible slander, ban the book right away."
russia.2.b:0 "It's rather funny, let it be."
russia.3.t:0 "A Fateful Day in Yalta"
russia.3.desc:0 "This vacation was everything Kolchak needed, and its end aggravated him. He was fishing along the Black Sea, relaxing and nearly falling asleep to the sound of waves crashing on the rocks. Then, in a flash, a squad of loyal army officers grabbed him and rushed him to their car. They had explained that they believed that Drozdovsky was attempting to assassinate him, and they had proof that anti-Kolchak agents disguised as anarchists had already raided his vacation home in an attempt to find him. Kolchak sighed, realizing that his short-lived vacation was now over.\n\nAs they drove through the streets of Yalta, desperately trying to reach the evacuation point at the airport, the driver realized they were being followed. As if on cue, shots rang from the following car, and the driver put the pedal to the floor and began to swerve. Loyalist officers in the back ordered Kolchak to get down, as they swung out pistols of their own and fired back, and friendly police cars started to attempt to intercept the assaulters vehicle. Drozdovsky’s assassins swerved off, and for a moment, it looked like they were gone.\n\nThey arrived at the airport, and Kolchak and his men ran to the airplane parked on the tarmac. Out of nowhere, the car from before burst through the gates, and the driver quickly pulled out his gun and opened fire on Kolchak. As the bullet sailed towards him, one thought crossed Kolchak’s mind:"
russia.3.a:0 "\"Goodnight, Rodina. The heavens have called me to sleep.\""
russia.3.b:0 "\"I shall not die yet. Russia still needs me!\""
russia.4.t:0 "The Death of Alexander Kolchak"
russia.4.desc:0 "\"It is with a heavy heart that I must announce that Alexander Kolchak, the Supreme Leader of all of Russia, is dead.\" Mikhail Drozdovsky declared over radio. The news was shocking; wasn’t he just on vacation? \"Yesterday at 2:00 in the afternoon, Kolchak and his men were attacked at an airport in Yalta by anarchists loyal to those bastards in Germany, and they were all killed in the ensuing firefight. In his place, I shall take over.\" This was believed by some, but challenger were already coming out of the woodworks. Ivan Romanovsky, a fellow general, declared that he had evidence that the \"anarchists\" were, in fact, agents of Drozdovsky, and that the people of Russia now needed to rally against him and his regime.\n\nThe military is split right down the middle on who to support. The navy had always been a pro-Kolchak stronghold, as he had been a naval officer and had invested heavily in upgrading the navy. The army, on the other hand, is strongly in favour of Drozdovsky, and many generals believe that sucking up to him will be better for getting spending in the long run. These divisions are going to be influencing our politics for years to come, it seems."
russia.4.a:0 "I thought the Japanese had it bad when it comes to sectarian military conflict!"
russia.5.t:0 "Kolchak Exposes Drozdovsky"
russia.5.desc:0 "“\"People of Russia, so fair and wise in your habits and traditions. Let me ask you; what is worse than a mere enemy?\" Kolchak asked over radio. He had miraculously survived an assassination attempt a day ago thanks to the sacrifice of the squad’s leading officer, who jumped in the way of the bullets to save him. \"What’s worse is a traitor! A backstabbing, snake in the grass, good for nothing traitor! And I know of one in our ranks; Mikhail Drozdovsky.\" He further alleged that Drozdovsky had disguised his men as anarchists in order to divert blame, and was attempting to make himself Supreme Leader of Russia.\n\nDrozdovsky has challenged these claims, and has further asserted that Kolchak had hired anarchist partisans in an attempt to eliminate him. In response to all of this, the military is split right down the middle on who to support. The navy had always been a pro-Kolchak stronghold, as he had been a naval officer and had invested heavily in upgrading the navy.

But they have now lost control, as the purge has progressed, certain groups of the Mladorossi, as well as the reactionary militias, have become more powerful than the government intended. With some factional fighting having broken out in Tatarstan, the two groups are now executing an armed struggle and are both threatening the internal stability of the Empire. Diterikh's populist militias and Aleksandr Kazam-bek's Mladorossi have grown into small armies in their own right. The Army has indeed reported rife defections, armouries have been raided, units dissolved and officers gone AWOL, the central government is now without the military means to end the conflict on their terms. So, with little appetite for yet more bloodshed among brothers, both sides have demanded an end to the hostilities before a wider war breaks out.

While the traitors in the army and government were being purged and removed from power in Russia, Socialist and Bolshevik activities during the Drozdovsky rebellion began to see a small rise in numbers as our government was preoccupied with dealing with the rebellion. The government seeing both an opportunity to get rid of the growing threat and a chance to unite Russia after the rebellion has begun to take measures to crack down on Socialists, and hopefully get rid of the socialist menace in Russia for good.\nWhile the purge on paper seems like an easy task to accomplish, in reality many of these Socialists are spread out and several have gone underground, making a purge with current resources a strain on the government. Many in the government are certain that the government will be able to handle the crisis, others aren’t as certain and have suggested to help deal with the Socialist vermin we recruit the help of more… radical elements of society. The support comes in the form of the Union of Young Russia, also known as the Union of Mladorossi or just Mladorossi, a party which espouses the return of the monarchy under a new Ideology of “Tsar and Soviets” and seems to have connections based in France. Another group that can support us is the followers of Mikhail Diterikhs whose radical Christian viewpoints and fanaticism can be of use in our purge.\nMany in the government however are opposed to working with these groups on principle, several stating that by working with them, it might help legitimise their status in Russia and allow them to grow in influence, creating a problem that the government set out to fix in the first place. Others oppose these factions for the simple fact that they might oppose our government in the future, and keeping them sidelined and powerless seems like a better option for long term stability and peace in Russia. However many others support and welcome their help as several government officials don’t see the harm in allowing radicals to help purge Socialist agitators across Russia, and view this as a way to contain their influence and allow them to be used as tools of the government.\nWhatever choice will be made, one thing is for certain.

The government has also begun to crackdown and censor anti-zionist movements and promote and elevate zionist organisations, which has lead to further emigration to Israel.\nDespite the government seeing more success in these measures, small communities of Jews still remain throughout Russia, although the Government believes it has peacefully resolved tensions between Jewish communities and their slavic neighbours."

The music then falls, as if diving into the depths of the blue sea, and then soars, as if into the sky, deep, strong, but… quite old-fashioned.\nThis \"Russian dance\" is coming to an end, but the couples continue to waltz, and the sound of boots rings in the ears. In the center of the hall, on a shiny parquet, dancing beautiful pairs of mother-of-pearl and crimson silk - ladies in embroidered kokoshniks and old-fashioned sundresses (oh, how many seamstresses and shoemakers worked on them!), and gentlemen in high kaftans, girded with colorful belts. Lubochnaya greatness, as if the time of Alexei Mikhailovich returned, for a moment, from its bed, covered with a sable fur coat of past epochs - returned to hide in the folds of classical canopies and modern waltzes of French courtiers. Where have you disappeared, a beautiful epoch of peace and idyll! ... Here is the master of the ball, the old Count Turov dancing with his respectable, furry-sabled wife, himself like a boyar from the epics. Senior Turov, Sasha, a dandy and a fashionista, with a thin black mustache and a quick look, is nearby. His partner, the young Sofia Troekurova, a model of pure youth, not yet tarnished with the storm of life, completely languished. Maybe it is too hot in a heavy dress or maybe look of Sasha too sensual. They are a beautiful couple. Here is a thin and strict stereotype of the Ostsee German, Andrew von Wenkenbach, trying to look as always decent, but still embarrassed under the stubborn pressure of Countess Ukhtomskaya. The ladies whisper with smiles that the Countess seems to have decided to stop being an old maid, she flatters the embarrassed Mr. Andrew so much. Not everyone dances - junior Turov, Roman, stood without a partner and participate in the sluggish conversations between those who do not dance. He is not in his plate, he is squeezed by the collar of his kaftan, even this room is squeezing him, to be honest. Roman would rather be in St. Petersburg again, among his non-noble friends, rather than these disheveled antiquities. But whatever, he promised his father, it would be very bad to embarrass him and not show up. Eventually, he and Alina will need this damn money, sooner rather than later.\nAnd then the music fades again, and this time finally.

She was beautiful. Youthful like spring but with knowing smile betraying wisdom of a woman beyond human age. Every detail of those massive portraits were in downright mathematical meticulousness chosen to soothe fears and anxieties of Her loyal subjects and bring fear in those hiding something from her blue gaze. Did she really look like that? Few really seen her up close. None would dare to deny. \n\nYuri sat in his chair, the old piece of bug-infested furniture creaked uncomfortably. He was a man in his late twenties but harsh winters and even harsher factory work gave him a face and hands of someone twice his age. Lack of sleep didn’t help neither. But how can one sleep when there are leaflets to print? Truth to spread? None of this even mattered anymore. They knew what he was doing. They took Sasha yesterday. By now he told them everything they could ever want to know and more. How did they figured them out? Was there a traitor among them? None of this even mattered anymore. Yuri rested his tired face in his cold hands. He didn’t even feel like crying. He didn’t feel like anything. He just wanted it to be over with. He won’t give those animals satisfaction of chasing him like a helpless rabbit. Chasing down prey is all they are good at. No sense in trying them. Those sick dogs like it. \n\nAt first there was this strange stillness. Untraceable air of incoming doom like that before a storm. But people still walked the streets, fat saleswoman still stood by her cart offering sweets to them. Children dressed in furry hats still stared hungrily at candy, their noses and cheeks red from the cold. Then the growl began. Monstrous, devilish noise made by packs of hungry dogs chasing after their prey. Primal and hateful, unfit for bustle of a city nor any place where civilized men dwelt. But also metallic and unnatural, not one any of God’s creatures can make. But people on the street knew what that noise was. It was way worse than howl of a hungry wolf or laughter of Devil himself. It was song of motorcycle engines of Her Majesty’s attack dogs. People moved aside. Some to make room for the incoming machines, some to press their faces against the wall and not see, not hear those black dogs, those hellhounds. \n\nRumors about them were too fantastical to believe but too frighting to ignore. They were dead warriors dug out of ancient kurhans and resurrected by some unknown science. They were demons bound by some saint into service to the crown. They were werewolves dressed like men and set to do government's bidding. They ate human flesh, they couldn’t be killed by normal weapons, they bleed engine oil and fire. \n\nYuri heard the roar of engines. They were coming. They didn’t worry he will run. No one will help him him. A man with Oprychnina on his back was a cursed man. The horde of savages clad in black leather, furs and animal skulls was able to sniff him everywhere and chase up to corners of the Empire. To help him was to sign your death warrant. To hide him was to condemn your family to prisons and worse. Yuri knew that they were after him.
