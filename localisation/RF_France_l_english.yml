#BOOKMARKS#
FRANCE_FUTURIST_DESC:0 "After their failure in the Great War, France was thrown into chaos as it's unstable Liberal Democracy collapsed onto itself. Street battles became commonplace and crushed any sense of peace. The masses demanded justice for the dead and the post war youth rejected reactionary traditions. While the Reactionaries - led by Action Française - took power, it was too late, as the economy collapsed following the shockwaves of the 1931 Crash. From this chaos, Antonin Artaud - Le Patron of the National Surrealist movement - rallied the masses and seized power. Now France is led by a radical new ideology, driven on by two needs: Speed, and Revenge."

#LEADER DESCRITIONS#
POLITICS_ANTONIN_ARTAUD_DESC:0 "Antonin Artaud, the Patron of France, has become the hero of the Artistic State, bravely leading the cliques of artists and disgruntled nationalists into a new nation. Antonin was born in 1896 in Marseille, and quickly became one of the most respected poets, writers, and dramatists in France, with a slow rise as his esoteric tastes in plays made him a favorite of many. With the collapse of the former French Republic, Artaud leads France steadily, with the reputation of a hero and liberator of the French nation against the Communist menace at its doorstep."
POLITICS_GEORGES_BATAILLE_DESC:0 "Georges Albert Maurice Victor Bataille has been called a "perverted degenerate", the "renegade surrealist", and the "dark side of the Artistic State", and now he sits at the top of the pile, leading the Artistic State to most ardently follow his beliefs regarding economics, social policy, and everything else. A deeply devoted anarch, he wishes to create a France devoid of government, law, and internationalism, and a drive towards excess, sexuality, and individualistic pleasure, along with mystical eroticism and aestheticism. Bataille's pious past in the Catholic Church made him deeply engaged with spiritualism and mysticism, harnessing a unique mindset for the future of France. The Renegade Surrealist has now risen from the backstreets of Le Soleil to the most respected aristocrat in the Artistic State."
POLITICS_BIATAYL_DESC:0 "Georges Albert Maurice Victor Bataille, the "perverted degenerate", and renegade surrealist, has taken over Mauritania in an act of defiance against the tyranny of Le Soleil's government, betrayed by all. He now sits in a palace in Nouakchott, waiting for the time to strike and liberate France from his enemies."

france.2.t:0 "Formal Military Dictatorship."

france.2.a:0 "May he bring stability to France."
france.5.t:0 "New Years Celebrations."
france.5.d:0 "To celebrate the New Year of 1936, Artaud, Le Patron of France, has organized an immense public party in Marseille. Beautifully ornate costumes and masks were encouraged, and lots of alcohol was made available. The party lasted until January 7th, with fireworks fired from artillery cannons across the city at every hour of every night. Huge bonfires roared ablaze fueled by the great stock of primitive Renaissance art. In particular, Artaud picked out The Annunciation, by Rogier van der Weyden, a 1400s painting, and ejaculated on it, before utterly destroying it with a powerful rifle and incendiary rounds, as crowds cheered loudly. The party had minimal coverage from the outside world, except for three American journalists with positive views towards France.\nThe party has caused major damage to the city, but everyone had a great time, and now volunteers are cleaning up the mess and the city continues to be as fiery and as fast as usual."
france.5.a:0 "Le Patron seemed to have fun."
france.6.t:0 "A Relaxing Dinner."
france.6.d:0 "Today, Patron Artaud was having a meeting with Georges Bataille - leader of the Acéphale - following Bataille's strange request to talk about "friendship" despite the strained tension between the newly estabilished cult around Artaud and the Acéphale secret society. Bataille offered Artaud some food and alcohol, and suddenly during the dinner, Artaud collapsed to the ground, unconscious. Georges Bataille quickly alerted Le Soleilians, and proclaimed himself the "Provisional Regent of France", in what some are calling a soft coup!"
france.6.a:0 "Seems like Artaud's public support got to his head."
france.7.t:0 "France at War Again."
france.7.d:0 "The delicate and fragile balance in Europe has finally been shattered as the Patron of France, Antonin Artaud, made a speech in Le Soleil declaring war on the United Kingdom.\n"Comrades, warrior-poets, riders of steel horses, priests of war, and lovers of art!"\nHe put down his cane and adjusted his scarf.\n"This crucial moment is our chance! We shall paint a great image over Britain! We will paint with our bombs, with our cars, and with their own blood. The plutocratic and reactionary regime of the United Kingdom has forced us to stand our ground and protect the oppressed masses of the world against the rotting corpse that is Anglo culture! The heart of this cancer, a bastion for the intellectually dull and meandering bourgeoisie is LONDON!"\nHe proclaimed, slamming his cane against the ground, and screaming energetically with dramatic, cathartic, and visceral gestures.\n"Our troops are ready to fight! The Acéphale have that their rituals and sacrifices are complete, so we can trust the Celtic gods in aiding our invasion!"\nArtaud then left the podium, walking over to a plane with speakers fitted on its sides.\n"The Anglo race has even failed to achieve the simplest of tasks - satisfying their women! We must help these poor souls out!"\nThe wise words of Le Patron echoed across our solar capital.\n"After our victory, we will put the Anglos in their rightful, historical place as a race of cuckolds! Our first aircrafts are on their way to London right now to drop lewd pictures of our troops, and love letters to future wives across The Channel."\nArtaud then flew away, throwing roses and firing his pistol into the air, to the clamor and praise of the residents of our great city."
france.7.a:0 "A conquest of land and women!"
france.8.t:0 "Strange, New Animals Gather."
france.8.d:0 "In the countryside, a new futurist faction within our movement - Clique Druidiste - is demonstrating their political influence by organising several Celtic pagan rituals in French forests. Most of their influence is in Brittany, but it’s slowly spreading as the younger generations discover the sexual rituals involved. This new subculture is heavily influenced by Yugoslav Zenitism and French Primitivism, declaring that Celtic tribes lived fast lives despite their technological backwardness as true speed comes from the mind, not technology.\nMarc Augier, who is hailed as "Mestr", has already organised his followers into a paramilitary group dressed in nothing but the furs of wild animals. In the night, they claim that they become true animals."
france.8.a:0 "Let them have their gathering."
france.8.b:0 "Warn them about the dangers of separatism."
france.10.t:0 "Papist Unrest!"
france.10.desc:0 "Our purging of the Papacy, while entirely necessary, has been met with immaturity and ingratitude. Across the rural countryside, peasants have been caught organizing prayers in secret, and our efforts in removing Christian imagery from historical buildings have been met with sabotage and resistance. Large masses of ignorant Papists have organized mass prayer demonstrations demanding a return to tolerance of their vile superstition. These protesters have already attacked police for simply containing their cries for attention. With the protests only growing in size, we must quickly respond."
france.10.a:0 "Let them be."
france.10.b:0 "Take care of it."
france.11.t:0 "Minds Under His Eye."
france.11.desc:0 "Millions of children across the nation have organized in excitement for their new school programs. Based on extensive research from our party’s greatest scientists, we have concluded that all human thought has originated from a common futurist singularity wholly embodied by our one great Patron. Therefore, with Le Patron's help, he have overhauled our entire education system to reflect this eternal truth. Our history books start with the ascension of Le Patron, our literature consists of Le Patron’s writings, and our mathematics are geared towards preparing a new generation of engineers, architects, and mechanics. Of course, some educators have expressed concerns that these reforms will do more harm than good, but with some digging, these teachers were found to require their own new education. Additionally, to ensure a consistent and efficient economy, our industrial production is now being adjusted and regulated according to these enlightened standards."
france.11.a:0 "Knowledge is like air, no one should be denied it."
france.12.t:0 "The Horde of One."
france.12.desc:0 "\"Who are you?\" Le Patron said to the void around him. \"We are all, we are within you.\" The voices responded. \"We are everything, and we are your dominion.\"\n\nLe Patron has emerged, against the deceitful lies about His mental state, as a godly pantheon bound by one body! All of existence has gazed in amazement at His incredible intellect, His might which evaporates all in His way! Now, however, He has told us amazing news; we are merely an extension of His own soul! Such great news has rocked the nation with joyous awe; people have lined up in the streets in a uniform silence, occasionally broken by a crying out of pure joy from some people. Those who had found themselves driven to hysterics by such wonderful news were quickly and humanely dispatched. Of course, a number of traitors were exposed during this revelation. In academia, and even among our own ranks, many found themselves relying on shifty \"facts\" and \"logic\" to dismiss the truth. Treason will not be tolerated, so these protests have been vanquished. The world is calling, and we will answer."
france.12.a:0 "My name is Le Patron, for we are one."
france.13.t:0 "Event of the Season!"
france.13.desc:0 "\"Islam is a uniquely futurist faith!\" Le Patron declared today, met by a thunderous applause from Muslims across our nation. \"While Europe sank into stagnation, disease, and decay, the Arab world entered into a golden age of wondrous advancement becoming the world's envy. From algebra, to kerosene, to even cryptanalysis... My brethren, without Islam’s gifts to the world, Futurism would not even exist today!\" The sheer force of this powerful speech drove out any withheld doubts towards Futurism, as the entire Islamic world found itself moved to follow the way of our great Patron. Even the most hardened critics found themselves silenced, the atmosphere of the Congress becoming a bubbling accelerationist frenzy. Truly, a kinship has been formed between our worlds."
france.13.a:0 "Vive le fraternité."
france.14.t:0 "Arabs on the Front!"
france.14.desc:0 "The communist scourge to our east poses a threat to all civilization. Every value they hold spells destruction for our grand society. It is not just in us that the Germans have found an enemy. Their egalitarian tyranny poses a threat to every people on this planet! Therefore, after revising the policies of our spineless predecessors, the Arabs will stand beside us in a united front against Germany. With our combined efforts, this beast will be slain!"
france.14.a:0 "Vive Le Patron!"
france.15.t:0 "Algerian algebra."
france.15.desc:0 "Millions of Arabian children sat in awe today as thousands of French teachers entered their classrooms to begin teaching. Most of these children have spent their lives in depression and squalor: when they weren’t working to feed their families through farming and begging, they would spend their time in the streets struggling to find entertainment. However, upon the great Patron’s recent Islamic Reformation Initiative, these impoverished children will now have the opportunity to learn valuable skills such as literacy and arithmetic. As Le Patron announced to a buzzing audience of children: \"With skill, practice, and sheer willpower, you can all become like your Patron!\""
france.15.a:0 "What's next, an Algerian novelist?"
france.16.t:0 "The Future is Prehistory."
france.16.desc:0 "\"When we find the roots of our misery, it shall bear the name of Caesar,\" Le Patron announced today, Augier standing at his side. \"When we lived in the age of Druids and nature, we were free; only when brought under the Latin yoke did we know stagnation and misery. Therefore, we must revise the lasting decadence from our late imperial carcass. We shall destroy the central demagogues, the Papal fools, and the accursed plow which has enslaved us so!\" Throughout the streets, Druidic cultists burned effigies of Caesar, Einstein, Ford, and other despots of machinery. Children lined up gleefully to receive face paintings of Celtic runes upon their face, while these same runes are carved into every building in Le Soleil. Despite tremendous support amongst our rural population, traitors within our industry cannot grasp the reason for their rightful expulsion from our society. For such insolence and treason, they shall greet justice in the faces of our wolves . . ."
france.16.a:0 "Gaule, reborn from ashes!"
france.17.t:0 "Shooter in the Capital!"
france.17.desc:0 "As the whole nation watched in glee upon Augier’s ascension to Second-In-Command, it seemed to be a second wind for the Futurist cause worldwide. There he stood, a glorious son of futurism - hair gleaming, smile shining, eyes glowing. Le Patron stood even more beautiful and proud than his deputy, his spirit radiating across all of France. However, as the crowd roared in celebration of these new declarations of the Futurist birthright, a treacherous and despicable shadow loomed amongst the patriots below. This shadow, later revealed to be a deranged Escadron fanatic, approached the great Augier as he radiated joy over the crowd. Being within three meters of our beloved Druid, the assassin pulled out a handgun and fired at Augier. The crowd recoiled in horror before several brave and glorious patriots tackled the gunman, beating him to death in a writhing mass of rage. However, a shot still left the gun, and . . ."

france.18.t:0 "The Hero Stands Strong."
france.18.desc:0 "\"I am a mere man. A bullet could very well have killed me instantly.\" Augier admitted to the shocked audience. \"But that pathetic stain upon humanity is proof of the technocrats’ weakness! You had only one job and yet: you failed, you disgusting piece of engineered horseshit. Your petty display shows the failures of your dependence on industry and technology. You have failed. Join your brethren in the footnotes of history.\" As the crowd roared and jeered at the bloodied pulp of a man being hauled away, Augier continued: "\This is not the first time a parasite has tried to slaughter us proud Gauls. We are strong, and we will forever destroy these Caesarian bastards. Long live the Celts!\""
france.18.a:0 "Vive Gaule!"
france.19.t:0 "Two Gods in a Hospital Room."
france.19.desc:0 "\"Great Patron, I don’t feel so good.\" Augier confessed to Artaud in his hospital bed. \"My body just feels . . . horrible, like insects crawling through my very soul.\"\n\"Well, you were just shot,\" Artaud chuckled, putting his hand on his protege’s shoulder.\n\"No, it’s not that. This body is just flesh, a mere mass of atoms hurtling towards the future. It’s my soul which aches. I close my eyes, and I just see the flash, feel the sting, hear the screams. God, those screams. Every moment, those screams ring just out of consciousness, screaming, yelling, serenading, for my demise. I wish they’d leave my head . . .\"\nArtaud leaned over to Augier, and whispered gently in his ear: \"Don’t worry, I hear them too.\"\nAugier’s eyes widened, before he uttered: \"So, why are they here? What do they want?"\n\"They want what’s best. Listen to them. They know more than you. Hear what they have to say."\n\"Augier contemplated, then gave an uneasy smile. \"I need to face this blinding light head on: the light of science, of reason, of the damned plow itself. I know my destiny.\""
france.19.a:0 "Glad to see you re-Wait, WHAT!?"
france.20.t:0 "O Green World."
france.20.desc:0 "Big news in France today as most of the industrial centers of the nation have been destroyed for forest reclamation programs. Le Soleil and other large cities have already been pulled down in all but their most essential buildings. Several large towns have also been evacuated to allow nature to reclaim its rightful place among the former infrastructure. The residents have been relocated to small and simple (luxuriously austere) houses in the South. In time they will learn to love these new forests and their new homes, but for now, protests have emerged throughout the nation. Of course, these poor urbanites will be found to have been deceived by traitors, and luckily our brave militiamen eliminated these subversive elements. Although a few say our ideas are too radical, the sight of a child finally being able to play safely in the woods is reason enough to disregard the detractors of the Druidic cause."

france.21.t:0 "Le Soleil Burns."
france.21.desc:0 "Millions of dreary men, women, and children march from the former city, escorted by our brave militias adorned in furs and robes. The scene produced a haunting show of the horrors of urban existence, as the crowd mourned over their suburban addiction. Poor children, entranced by the industrial opium, burst into tears upon being escorted from their homes. Even some pathetic adults broke down from their withdrawal. Luckily, our militiamen were there to knock some proper sense into the crowd, lest others not realise their addiction. Upon marching a mile from the city, the crowd’s tears were illuminated by a sudden blaze from their former home. The shantytown homes that made up Le Soleil's slums had provided kindling for the blaze, while armed explosives destroyed the major landmarks. The crowd cried out in anguish as the Eiffel tower became a monstrous, twisted, metal skeleton. Some lashed out against the militia, but were repelled with rightful force. As the caravan began to move them to their wonderful new shelters, a woman began to cry uncontrollably. As a militiaman calmed her, the following conversation was recorded:\n\nWoman: \"I can’t go on . . . I lost everything . . . (sobs)\"\nMilitia: \"What do you mean? You now have freedom, austerity, autonomy, and liberation from the iron grip of industry. A couple of buildings lost is worth your dignity.\"\nWoman: "You misunderstand . . . my son never left the apartment.\""

So far, our birthrates have quadrupled, and, with nature taking its natural course, a new, stronger generation of warriors is on the horizon. However, when we allowed open love-making, we never imagined that a certain . . . \"flamboyance\" would emerge. This morning, as some of our militiamen investigated odd noises coming from a local settlement, a grizzly sight emerged: eighteen men were found engaging in . . . pleasures of their own. Even some prominent local leaders were found in the orgy, shocking the foundation of our support. With this knowledge, another fifty-one gay relationships were exposed within our borders! Unfortunately, our lack of government prevents us from doing anything about it."

A massive horde of Druid loyalists marched upon a bunker in the Ardennes, containing a cartel of Nungesser loyalists. Unfortunately, as our brave men approached the bunker, the damned industrial weapons quickly gained the upper hand, tearing many of our brave warriorss apart. As the bloody battle continued and our men refused to stop advancing, some of our valiant heroes used suicidal demolition attacks to destroy many of the artillery pieces. Eventually, the weary cowards surrendered to a plea deal for their lives. Of course, we do not entertain any regrets from traitors, so we promptly slaughtered them on the spot. One of these traitors was Nungesser himself, whose corpse could not be recovered following a bout of severe torture from our valorous heroes. Still, this battle has exposed many humiliating flaws in our system . . ."

Flickering torches in the misty morning, shouting men and women begging not to be thrown out into the street. A knife, a broomhandle, an iron poker, he wanted something, something to defend himself. Surely, though, appearing in front of the Druids with a weapon would only make this worse. Surely, he thought, he could snake his way out of whatever they had planned. Essential worker, or . . .or he could say he was preparing the final pieces of . . .\nThere was another series of knocks, a meaty fist slamming against his door. Dammit, dammit all! He opened the door.\n“May I help you?” He half-slurred.\n“It is time to leave,” a central figure said, flanked by two torch-bearers. All were covered, head to toe, in sackcloth robes. He couldn’t see their faces, save their eyes. Intense, reflective eyes that peered out from behind a wooden mask. “By order of the Druidic Council, Nice shall be reclaimed by nature, and its citizens freed from the shackles of Civilization. Follow us.”\n“But, you see,” Andre tried to defend himself. Panic set in, and before he could say anything, one of the torch-bearers grabbed him by the arm, practically throwing him out into the street. He joined the group of massed citizens, hundreds of neighbours, scared, tired, huddling. The last he saw of his home, before he was lost in a sea of people, was a robed figure bringing a can of petrol inside.\nThe throng, with sword and rifle, were forced to march."

Today was not a normal training flight, instead of their usual instructor the squadron was led by a warrior-priest. He was dressed in a rough ox-skin jacket, which along with his helmet was painted in ornate and colourful patterns.\n\nAs they got into their planes and left the airfield, Anton's adrenaline was already rushing through his veins. They flew lower than normal for a good while until suddenly he could hear the warrior priest's voice through the radio, distorted by noise. \"Ok men, after me!\" the Priest said as Antonie could see his plane fly straight up into the sky, with the rest of the squadron following suit. It was then Antonie could feel it. As the G-forces was pushing on his body he could feel his Soul escaping his body, behind him the curtains of reality were unveiling, revealing the superworld. As his Soul was ascending he could feel the marrow in his bones being pushed down towards the ground. Whilst the Priest was chanting nonsensically through the radio Antonie felt his soul leaving him completely, the sensation knocking him unconscious. When he regained his senses he was in a black tunnel, at the end of it he saw the ground accelerating towards him, as he travelled through the tunnel closer to its opening he could feel himself regain power over his body.\n\nHe was shot out of the tunnel and back into reality, his plane speeding down towards the Earth. Antonie quickly, almost instinctively, pulled up his plane, again experiencing the orgasmic feeling of his soul leaving its mortal prison, almost losing consciousness again. It was only once Antonie re-joined the formation of planes that he truly regained his sense of reality, the low rumble that had covered his ears quickly turned to his friends' voices coming from the radio. \"Antonie!? Antonie are you alright!?\"\n\n\"Yes. I'm doing great.\""

Suddenly he heard his comrade’s voice in the radio, \"Enemies coming in 12 O'clock.\". He looked up and saw in the distance, slightly below them many formations of planes heading straight in their direction. Finally, what he signed up for. Already the Brits had started firing against them, their bullets whizzed past the formations below him, already speeding up, like rows of Napoleonic soldiers advancing on the British lines at waterloo. But he was above them. The planes below him were foot soldiers, he and his squadron were the Cavalry, the Escadron.\n\"Very well men, at my signal.\" Antonie said, carefully awaiting the moment, \"Now!\" he shouted, shooting his plane straight towards the British planes. As his plane and comrades accelerated towards the enemy, Antonie was no longer in his plane, in fact he was no longer on earth. He had been transported to space, like he had many times before, around him were stars and planets, at his side armies of angles were flying past him, on their way to annihilate anything in their path. But Antonie did not care for them, he was focused on controlling his empty body in his plane, like a remote-controlled robot. Antonie’s squadron was charging the enemy from above, their heads filled with blood, their eyes were bloodshot and Antonie saw reality in a red hue. He pressed down on his triggers, his face was bright red and grimaced by the g-force. Bullets began spraying out the undersides of his wings, the expensive and carefully crafted planes of the British where torn to shreds like paper. Their pilots, middle aged, well trained and prepared where mangled and mutilated, like the body of a worm being pulled off the hook of an unsatisfied fishermen’s rod, their bodies were thrown into the sea, along with the hole filled heaps of metal they once rode in.\n\nAs the battle ended and Antonie and his squad returned to flying as they had before, he could finally see the rim of England. Large peaceful plains rested on gigantic shelves of stone over the ocean’s surface. The calm landscape helplessly looking on as the uncountable bombers behind rows of planes slowly made their way towards them, ready to annihilate all."

"For too long, we have found our spirits bound by petty things like morality and austerity. If we wish to reach a further plane of reality, we must delve into the great reaches of the mystically orgasmic beyond!" Le Patron declared to a crowd of enthralled supporters. Immediately after delivering a powerful ode to immorality, he passed the spotlight to Bataille. Bataille immediately began a tirade on the esoteric potential of hedonism, in which he recounted an extraordinarily enlightening experience he had with several of Paris’s finest prostitutes. Then he began relaying his promises: to the children he promised the finest sweets and candies; to the adults he promised sex and hallucinogens. As he made this decree, a unit of Acephale partisans walked throughout the crowd, handing out gifts of chocolate and opium respectively. Despite massive euphoria amongst the crowds, a few hard-line Escadronists and Druidists protested at the event; even Augier and Nungesser themselves somehow managed to cooperate in jointly leading the protests. However, upon being escorted into the Palais Bourbon, the protesters were greeted by a crowd of our nation’s finest women adorned in very little. Needless to say, after hours of pleasure on the very capital floors, the men finally understood our grand vision for spiritual liberation.

Such exercises in defiance at this point in time are minor. Nothing more than acts of cultural insolence. A flag of the old republic here, the spouting of old adages of a past revolution there, and the worship of some irreverent ‘Savior’ (certainly not our Artaud!).

However, despite these grand dreams, Nungesser had one major oversight; he knows absolutely nothing about law. As he made his opening remarks, he clearly put very little thought into creating an argument; he quickly lost his professionalism and began rambling about how decadence is anti-Futurist for vague and illogical reasons. As eventually, as he found himself losing the previously-sympathetic courtroom, he began screaming at the defendant, calling her a disgusting reactionary and traitor to the futurist cause. While Ms. Clemence certainly wasn’t popular, very few people could justify Nungesser’s mad ravings. Eventually, he ran out of steam, and began timidly questioning the bewildered woman; even still, he struggled to attribute any particular crime to her. After this haphazard effort, he gave up."

Despite Abram’s reluctance, he still managed to assemble an excellent defense in favor of the woman. He clearly explained that her actions, while disgusting to us on a moral level, were indisputably ethical. After all, she did not harm any living creature, her sale of her fetus was based on voluntary exchange, and after the latest Decadence Decree, she couldn’t have violated any obscenity laws for they no longer existed!

One even managed to throw a bottle at Clemence’s head, shattering and cutting her face before the man could be detained. The woman gave one last plea for mercy before she was forcibly slammed into the bull. As the bull gave its infamous steam whine, her screams of pain could barely be heard.

At least, his mouth wasn't saying that. Something flashed in the corner of his eye. Was that a person? Surely, one of the privates, just passing through a nearby corridor. Yes. Yes, exactly, a private moving nearby. In this room that had only one door, no corridors, and just he and Maurice. That...didn't make sense. But it was...the only explanation. He wasn't crazy, after all. Absolutely not. The people who were insane...they were the ones in power. If he was fighting them, he wasn't insane. That's how it worked, right? That's how it worked!\n\nThe tugging, tugging, tugging! Someone had looped a chain through the back of his skull, he could feel it, the wounds, the dragging friction of metal. It hurt, it hurt so much. The tugging, the chain, pulling his brain out from his fucking skull!\n\nArtaud opened his eyes, and breathed out a sigh of relief. It was over. He...he was in control now. Gather yourself, Artaud, let yourself...where were you? Oh, my poor man, what had you gotten yourself into? You lose focus for a few days, and now...\n\n\"Friend,\" some man he had seen in his most crisp and clear of nightmares was speaking to him. \"Are you quite alright?\"\n\n\"I...\" everything clicked. Everything made sense, in one terrible, cruel, realization. \"I apologize, my...friend,\" he adjusted, trying to figure out what was going on. He was in a building. Abandoned, yes, he could tell that by the...the dust on the windows and the...yes. Okay. This man was speaking, talking about propaganda, about posters, recruiting, arming. He nodded along, listening to whatever he had to say.\n\n\"Of course,\" Artaud said, pointing to a specific part on the map. \"We could try to strike here,\" he pointed at the mansion of someone he quite disliked. Some idiot who really didn't believe in him, or in futurism, and merely in his own power. Eliminating him would be useful, and if these idiots could do it and get themselves arrested, even better.\n\n\"Hmm,\" Maurice said. \"Yes, I think so. Thank you, Friend.

It didn't matter. He sat, and watched the madman rave.\n\nThree militia-men were laughing with each other, talking about the man they were charged with executing. It was a mercy, really. Sometimes, people were just so far-gone that to call them people anymore was a form of torture. There were many madmen in France, people so blinded by some love of the past, some desire to preserve what never worked, and Artaud just...did not understand it. It was understandable, of course, that one would want to keep things the same. Status quos are comfortable. But they are also the bane of progress, something to be disregarded despite the discomfort. The unknown, the fear that you felt with something new, was no different than the pain in muscles one had after a good run. It was a sign of improvement. Those who denied that would rather watch their own collapse than embrace their future.\n\nAnd now, Artaud watched the militia raise their rifles. Maurice stared at him, trying...trying to find some of remanent of mercy, some humanity, something other than pure calculation, in his eyes.\n\nHe found none, and died sobbing."

What was once typical squabbles in the various Parsian clubs has turned into fistfights with some cases even involving weapons. One such incident occurred between supporters of Pierre Clementi and adherents of Marcel Bucard’s economic policy. In a Parisian bar a heated discussion between the two groups turned first to name calling, the Clementi faction calling Bucard’s supporters \"bourgois dogs\" and the \"vestiges of the old corrupt regime who should of been burned alongside it\" whilst the advocates for Bucccard named the Clementists as \"degenerate communists who should fuck off to Germany\", which then turned into a frightful scuffle. As the fight spilled out onto the streets, blood threatened to swarm the district as the combattants brandished knives, brass knuckles, clubs and razors. As heads were beaten, eyes were slashed and bodies mutilated it soon became apparent to all those who had heard the news of the clash that the Escadron was not as united as it appeared. The display of ruthless unabashed violence by apparent members of the same organisation meant this issue had to be put to bed and soon.

In order to ensure that, we’ve begun meetings and discussions with Henry Dorgères, the leader of the Green Shirts and the founder of numerous Peasants’ Defense Committees. Dorgères had been an important figure during the overthrow of the republicans, as his Green Shirts were often the shock troops against republican revival in the countryside, most infamously during the suppression of a republican revolt in the Vendée region. However, he was dismayed by the popularity of the Escadron and Acephale factions, and started to help organize support for the Druidists out of spite.\nHenry Dorgères has put forward two demands; one, that the Green Shirts are recognized by the government as a legitimate organization, and that the Peasants’ Defense Committees are merged with the government to ensure that the countryside is safe from any danger. This is a lot to ask, but Dorgères has been a helpful figure, and it may do us well to work with him."

france.200.desc:0 "Our northern neighbour, Wallonia, is a mistake. It is barely a state, real or fake. It is obsolete and artificial. It began as a feudal remnant, some place for the Habsburgs to rest their wretched chins after returning from their niece's bedrooms. Next, the Huns run through it. As they're particularly and pathetically slow thinkers, flittering between servile monarchism and servile socialism, the Germans just left the non-state to rot! They set up a military government, forgot to install a puppet prince. A single worker and soldier's council tried to invade; they gave up in a bleak Wallonian field. The German occupation government there let itself diminish, half running off to Prussia, half devoting themselves to a new native military government. Isn't that ridiculous? You stay for so long in Wallonia, and you lose your purpose. You become a dinosaur, watching the economy decline, watching the world move on without you.\n\nLuckily, we can fix that! Jules Schmalzigaug is a futurist who understands how dreary the Wallonian construct is. Although he is both a native speaker of fake Flemish and he considers himself more inspired by the Italians, he has conjured up la Fraternité française futuriste, a brotherhood for all Wallonians who remember their Latinate heritage, and understand that France is the future of futurism. They have requested military assistance in crushing the Wallonian government. It would be foolish to deny them this, though we might gain some amusement in watching a home grown civil war."

The laws of history practically ordain his victory. Back when worthless Wallonia was part of boring Belgium, Schmalzigaug was at the brink of despair - as any decent man should be, living in such an area. Schmalzigaug found meaning during his time in Venice - he was a futurist even before our dearest Patron! - and during the French Insurgence, joining an escadron and warring against the French Faction of the Socialist International. Our Schmalzigaug lives in front of everyone else: despite being a Hun at heart, he sees more deeply than the average Frank. He's ahead of all trends; his enemy is stuck in the past. When he wins, we will surely accord him a place in the Chamber of Demiurges.\n\nOur opponent in every way is Herman Baltia. A wannabe generalissimo probably selected to rule Wallonia by the imperialist German Military Government for his German ancestry, Baltia has ruled by decree ever since. The very definition of a wretched old man, we hear that Baltia paints soggy watercolours whenever he's not demanding that any Frenchman who voices even slight opposition to his rule is beaten down. Due to Wallonia having very little involvement in the unorganised civil conflicts in 18 and 19, we presume that his military experience is relegated to shooting blacks if they don't get him enough rubber and throwing himself under the German heel."

They ignored the debris and the bodies of the past. Why look at that awful stuff, when you can pay attention to men and women throwing themselves at your feet? Free hugs, free kisses, free food: everyone singing French songs in that beautifully discordant way. Synchronised singing is overrated. Wallonia's overwhelmed with passion; Wallonia's reached her limit. Wallonia's drunk on violence and militancy. If her choir was nice, orderly, innocent church boys and innocent church girls, you'd think she didn't care. Everyone's incoherency spilling onto the streets is a sign that something spectacular has occurred. The cacophony is really bliss.\n\nJules Schmalzigaug gave a speech in the Élysette, Baltia's former residence. Wallonia is now an integral part of France; it will never be separated again. Still, the work of the French people is never done. Now Wallonia and France are united, they must spread the light of futurism across Europe and then the globe. If that didn't suffice, Artaud himself appeared behind Schmalzigaug! He congratulated the crowd on freeing themselves from delay, reminding them of their travail under the German occupation government and its successor state. Jules broke into tears, threw himself into Antonin's arms. \"Now, we are truly children of France!\"\n\nIt never stops. Today, St. Aubin's Cathedral burns. It was made by the Pope 350 years ago.
