BLR_DESC_MENU:0 "A fiefdom under ataman Stanisław Bułak-Bałachowicz, Belarus is at the crossroads. Many factions within the country oppose the ataman's dictatorship, each for their own reason. There are supporters of democracy and supporters of more radical, reactionary dictatorship; there are factions in Belarusian secret service, whose leadership wants to make Belarus into a beacon of second socialist revolution; there are sinister foreign officers whose plans involve transformation of Belarus into something different; and there is always a place for madmen, whose true plans remain unknown - who shall fall, and who shall rise, who comes to lead Belarus into an uncertain future?"

#CUSTOM TOOLTIPS AND FLAGS#
#DECISIONS (1.5 Update)#
#FOCUSES#
BLR_fiefdom_ataman:0 "Fiefdom of Ataman"
BLR_fiefdom_ataman_desc:0 "Since the fall of Russian rule in the area of Belarus, it was the Ataman who led it. Unlike Ukraine and Lithuania, which are democracies, or Poland (which is held together by Cult of Marshal), Belarus is a true dictatorship, where the ruling clique holds power only by the iron will of one man - the Ataman himself."
BLR_review_military:0 "Review Military Budget"
BLR_review_military_desc:0 "A rather routine task, military budget reviewing is done every year to decide what should be done to keep the military of Belarus alive."
BLR_review_civilian:0 "Reviewing Civilian Budget"
BLR_review_civilian_desc:0 "Not to be outdone, various civilian groups of influence kowtow to Ataman no less often than the military industrialists, because state can’t spend all money on the military, civilian budget also must be reviewed."
BLR_power_struggle:0 "The Power Struggle"
BLR_power_struggle_desc:0 "Fortunately, the budget accounting is complete. Unfortunately, it became apparent that neither our public nor our military are monolithic, with so many factions existing - and all of them being against Ataman in their power struggle."
BLR_watch_out_polish:0 "Watch out for Polish"
BLR_watch_out_polish_desc:0 "Poland may be our ally, not to mention the leader of Intermarium, but their influence has become more and more of an obstacle to Belarusian superiority. We should be wary both of Polish troops stationed near our borders, of diplomats scheming in Minsk, and of exiled Polish officers who often have close ties with Belarusian high society and, most concerning, our military. This simply can’t continue as it is."
BLR_question_constitution:0 "Question of Constitution"
BLR_question_constitution_desc:0 "Belarus is a Republic. This is clear. But due to a chain of unfortunate events, our constitutional project was never finished, power of Ataman being legally de-facto unrestricted. Shall we write a proper Constitution, or let the Ataman govern as he wishes?"
BLR_purge_or_not_purge:0 "To Purge or not to Purge"
BLR_purge_or_not_purge_desc:0 "When observing the petty conflicts of multitude of factions, Ataman’s closest advisors, including the secret intelligence units of Asobny Atrad, recommended to purge the enemies of Belarus in one swift move. But would the Ataman even do it, granted how those who would be purged include not just power-hungry officers or insignificant criminals, but intellectuals and scientists as well? Or will he cleanse the apparatus of the state without showing any remorse to cement his power?"
BLR_eternal_dictator:0 "Eternal Dictatorship"
BLR_eternal_dictator_desc:0 "Stanislaw’s enemies were crushed, none dare to oppose him. It can be said with full certainty, that the Ataman reigns supreme, the dictatorship in Belarus is going to be eternal."
BLR_one_way_or_another:0 "One Way or Another..."
BLR_one_way_or_another_desc:0 "While it is tempting to say that Ataman may get away with the way he restricts civil liberties, allows his cronies to abuse the system, and overall behaves like a bandit, some voices in Belarusian society pray, that one way or another, the dictatorship comes to end. But what kind of system will come to power instead?"

BLR_belarussian_democracy:0 "Belarusian Democracy"
BLR_belarussian_democracy_desc:0 "Finally, after a historic compromise, Belarus is a democracy. Politics were opened up for new parties, people feel less oppressed than anytime before, but this is not the end of our struggle. It is only beginning."
BLR_parliamentary_elections:0 "Parliamentary Elections"
BLR_parliamentary_elections_desc:0 "To accomplish the civic society’s aspirations, Belarus must elect its Rada. Two parties contend - BSH and BNP, the later is also torn between the more mainstream Conservatives and the Liberals of Kreczeuski. The people decide, and tomorrow we’ll know who will lead our nation as its first democratically elected President."
BLR_bsh_coalition:0 "BSH-led Coalition"
BLR_bsh_coalition_desc:0 "The Biełaruskaja Satsijalistychnaja Hramada, or Belarusian Socialist Assembly has attracted the more Liberal elements of BNP, forming a centre-left coalition as a result. Despite \"Socialist\" in its name, BSH is moderately Social Democratic, and will surely make society of Belarus just, and its welfare system - existing not just on paper."
BLR_bnp_coalition:0 "BNP-led Coalition"
BLR_bnp_coalition_desc:0 "The Biełaruskaja Niezaležnickaja Partyja, or Belarusian Independence Party has united both its Liberal and Conservative members around a single goal - upholding independence of Belarusian Democratic Republic, and introducing a more just yet even more capitalist system, compatible with existing Belarusian society."
BLR_welfare_state:0 "Welfare State"
BLR_welfare_state_desc:0 "BSH promises the citizens of Belarus adequate living conditions, mandatory health insurance and other stuff known in the more civilized countries as \"welfare\". By making this promises a reality, Belarus will surely catch up to the better developed states."
BLR_human_rights:0 "Protect Human Rights"
BLR_human_rights_desc:0 "So many groups - beginning with intellectuals and ending with minorities - faced discrimination and abuse from the Ataman’s forces back when that brute was in power. But our Human Rights Court will prevent such disgrace from occurring ever again."
BLR_deregulation:0 "Deregulation"
BLR_deregulation_desc:0 "The old undemocratic government did a lot to regulate our economy, thinking it’s protecting the people that way, but in truth they only opened an avenue to cheaper Polish products, effectively rendering our entrepreneurship disadvantaged. We must deal with this problem - by conducting deregulation, and freeing the humble businessmen of Belarusian nation from the bureaucrat’s grip."
BLR_patriotic_education:0 "Patriotic Education"
BLR_patriotic_education_desc:0 "Our children must be educated, but what should they learn? Obviously, the good Belarusian values and the price our patriots must be ready to pay for the people’s prosperity."
BLR_lift_censorship:0 "Lift Press Censorship"
BLR_lift_censorship_desc:0 "As of today, there’s no reason to impose any restrictions on our writers’ and editors’ creativity. Let the free press exist!"
BLR_better_belarus:0 "A Better Belarus"
BLR_better_belarus_desc:0 "You wouldn’t believe us, the tales we could tell, although, truth be told...it started very poorly. But the Great Apostate - the Usurper, the Ataman - is now no longer an active figure in politics, and as such he doesn’t object to the grand transformation that Belarus underwent. One would think - \"Could a country which was under a dictatorial rule for thirteen years change in merely a year?\". We are an example of such rapid change. Belarusian Democratic Republic is a much better country to live than ever before, and who knows, maybe other Belarusians will follow its lead one day."

BLR_foreign_clique:0 "Foreign Clique Conspiracy"
BLR_foreign_clique_desc:0 "What many thought was unthinkable, what was so many times denied and debunked both by Belarusians and by the Polish, something simply nonsensical to so many people, finally happened. Gone is the power of Ataman, now a clique of adventurous foreigners holds the power - through their many connections in the Belarusian military, through intimidation of opponents and overall lack of opposition. The ship of state is now controlled by people indifferent to the fate of the common folk, but with the entire country at their disposal - for whatever sinister purpose it may be."
BLR_invite_uladzimir:0 "Invite Uladzimir Kirylavič to Minsk"
BLR_invite_uladzimir_desc:0 "Granted how understandably low is new clique’s legitimacy, it was decided one day after the lunch that monarchy would be the best form of transforming Belarus according to the new leadership’s wishes, and as such a Romanov was invited to Minsk - duke Vladimir Kirillovich, the legitimate successor to Russian throne, whose father however was exiled to Britain and felt a strong disdain towards Kolchak’s Russia, disdain only strengthened in his son. Vladimir replied to a letter of Tinz with an enthusiastic three-page response, describing how he would be eager to take command, and that he already started learning Belarusian language. So far, it’s all going just as planned."
BLR_ruthenian_empire:0 "Proclaim the Ruthenian Empire"
BLR_ruthenian_empire_desc:0 "With Uladzimir’s plane arriving safely to Minsk, veil of secrecy was torn, and to the shocked world an announcement was made - no longer Belarus will be a leaderless cripple of a nation, a new sovereign, a new Emperor will lead the White Ruthenians towards their glory, - Ruthenian Empire is here, and no amount of enemies will stop it from its destiny!"
BLR_manifesto:0 "Publish the Imperial Manifesto"
BLR_manifesto_desc:0 "Proclamation of our Empire was met with somewhat better public response than we expected, but it was also met with confusion - both domestically and abroad. After all, what business does a Romanov and a bunch of Polish and Russian officers have in Belarus, creating what many would think of as an \"unnatural country\". Which means, that in order to better explain what do we stand for, and what policies will our state pursue, an Imperial Manifesto must be published, showing to the world that we indeed have a purpose."
BLR_five_races:0 "Five Races under One Banner"
BLR_five_races_desc:0 "Unlike the Nationalists, we do not recognize any race as inferior or superior. Granted our Empire’s historically diverse and vibrant population, we uphold the notion that our Empire must be built by five races, all sharing common destiny in the lands of Ruthenia: White Ruthenians, Muscovites, Polish people, Lipka Tatars and Ashkenazi Jews. These groups have a bond, forged by blood, which entitles them to equal rights under our rule, protection from discrimination and a reason to be loyal to Ruthenian Empire. The banner of Five Races shall rise over Ruthenian land, now its meaning clear to all!"
BLR_claimant_of_rus:0 "The Sole Claimant of Old Rus"
BLR_claimant_of_rus_desc:0 "As a true Ruthenian state, we trace our origins to the ancient polity of Rus’, established by foreign adventurers with assistance of local Slavs - just like our Empire, basically. We won’t wait for our rivals to disappear - we will force that event to come sooner, because there could be only one true heir to Rurik’s domain."
BLR_reform_imperial_army:0 "Reform Imperial Military"
BLR_reform_imperial_army_desc:0 "While Belarus had a relatively decent military, it wasn’t strong enough even to keep our borders safe. As we are preparing for Imperial conquest, it is absolutely necessary to reform our troops, agitate our people so that they join the Imperial Army, and research new weapons to gain an upper hand over the false Rus."
BLR_entrench_monarchy:0 "Entrench Absolute Monarchy"
BLR_entrench_monarchy_desc:0 "Uladzimir may not tolerate such things as parliamentarism or free elections, but his benevolence allows him to be our supreme ruler, our absolute monarch, our sovereign by whose grace the five races have received their privileges and Ruthenia as a whole received her purpose. Which means that while the original clique still serves him as advisors, in public he must be perceived as an undeniable sovereign."
BLR_finland_to_japan:0 "From Finland to Japan"
BLR_finland_to_japan_desc:0 "When we were talking about expanding Ruthenia to match our claim of being an Empire, we weren’t joking - all lands once held by our Emperor’s dynasty, from Helsinki to Vladivostok, must be brought under the Imperial flag, local population assimilated into either of our races and all resistance to realization of Ruthenia’s destiny crushed."
BLR_ruthenia_stands:0 "Ruthenian Empire stands Triumphant"
BLR_ruthenia_stands_desc:0 "Those who ridiculed us today no longer feel confident in their judgement, because what our Emperor and his advisors promised to Ruthenian people is delivered to them - for after a truly heroic struggle, Ruthenian destiny is realized, \"five races banner\" hoisted over the Muscovite towns, Imperial forces crushing the remaining resistance from the Baltic to the Pacific. It is time to offer a toast - to the thousand year Empire of Ruthenia!"

BLR_pale_horse:0 "The Pale Horse"
BLR_pale_horse_desc:0 "Nobody anticipated this, yet it is here - Boris Savinkov, the most wanted terrorist in Russia’s recent history, an ideologue in "right wing" of Party of Socialist Revolutionaries and its de-facto leader, who also coincidentally had a comfortable position in Asobny Atrad, now proclaimed his rule over Belarus as its first truly socialist president. Public is, notably, in shock - Savinkov held quite a reputation, and years of exile away from his true motherland only deepened his worst qualities. But nothing could be done anymore, for the Pale Horse is here, and what it means for Eastern Europe only the wisest can predict."
BLR_approach_terrorists:0 "Approaching the Terrorists"
BLR_approach_terrorists_desc:0 "Not all Socialist Revolutionaries have abandoned the bomb and revolver in favor of pen and crayon. A rather sinister faction of terrorist SRs had refused back then in 1924 to join Belarusian Secret Intelligence, but now these old sharp-shooters can be useful again - against Russian Empire, against the evil of Kolchak."
BLR_negotiation_partisants:0 "Negotiations with Partisans"
BLR_negotiation_partisants_desc:0 "While a great deal of our comrades in the spy community supported the SR cause, a faction of secret agents and their paramilitary goons called "Partisans" refused to listen to Savinkov’s orders, instead preferring to lie low in Pripyat marshes. However, by talking with their rather Reactionary, but professional leader, our chief Boris Savinkov will try to bring those brigands back under control."
BLR_contacts_acephale:0 "Contacts in the Acephale"
BLR_contacts_acephale_desc:0 "While not the best guys from moral point of view, and rather sceptical not just of our socialism, but of socialism as a whole, the Acephale offer a rather cheap price for their weaponry, and their lifestyle, although decadent, shows us an example of how a partisan might behave. We don’t care about their ideology, or about their art taste - what matters is their influence on French leadership, which could arrange some smuggling through Germany and Poland to Belarus easily than anyone else in Europe."
BLR_war_with_kolchakocracy:0 "War of Kolchakocracy’s Annihilation"
BLR_war_with_kolchakocracy_desc:0 "Now, when all influence is ours, the troops are ready, the infiltrators have crossed the border and weapons have been stockpiled in advance, we can denounce the counterrevolutionaries completely and declare an all-out war on Russian leadership, continuing it even if the Admiral won’t lead those thugs anymore."
BLR_destroy_populist:0 "Destroy Populist Demagoguery"
BLR_destroy_populist_desc:0 "We can’t be sure of our land’s integrity and of our people’s loyalty until they are not properly indoctrinated, until there exists such thing as various bourgeois parties, using populism and demagoguery to distract the Belarusian people from the true goal - from triumph of socialism."
BLR_unite_revolutionaries:0 "Unite the Social Revolutionaries"
BLR_unite_revolutionaries_desc:0 "Party of Socialist Revolutionaries was crushed by Kolchak’s brutality, but it wasn’t gone. A faction here, a faction there, an entire reconstituted party in Zheltorossiya, - but here, in Belarus, we must unify all factions - Russian SRs, Belarusian SRs, terrorist SRs and the like-minded leftists - into a single party yet again, for only unity guarantees victory."
BLR_introduce_agrarian_socialism:0 "Agrarian Socialism"
BLR_introduce_agrarian_socialism_desc:0 "In order to keep the Belarusian rural population calm, we shall proceed with long-promised agrarian reforms, effectively granting the villagers their long deserved autonomy, land of remaining nobles socialized and every village having its own peasants’ council. That way, people of Belarus will be less likely to complain."
BLR_industrialization:0 "Industrialization for Murderous Purposes"
BLR_industrialization_desc:0 "While villages are our breadbaskets and recruitment pools, the towns and cities must be brought under industrial authority of the Party, military industry prioritized over the largely obsolete civilian one, for there is no higher purpose than to eliminate our Revolution’s external enemies!"
BLR_arms_trade:0 "Arms Trade"
BLR_arms_trade_desc:0 "If we are to achieve the satisfaction for what Kolchak’s brutes did to our Revolution, we must show indifference towards the more secondary aspects of socialistic doctrine, and dive into the world of illegal arms shipments and black market - end justifies the means, and it is better to control the illegal trade yourself than let the counterrevolutionaries do it instead."
BLR_no_mercy:0 "No Mercy for the Merciless"
BLR_no_mercy_desc:0 "Now, when our ability to influence our comrades through arms shipment has been improved, we can intensify our operations - middle-level bureaucrats, border guards, Black Hundreds members and other such nasty people in regions of Russia near Belarusian border must be eliminated, for how they didn’t show mercy to the proletariat, we also won’t show mercy to these parasites ourselves."
BLR_dont_call_us_evil:0 "Don’t Call us Evil"
BLR_dont_call_us_evil_desc:0 "Majority is too terrified of our reputation as terrorists and cold-blooded murderers to voice their opinion, but those who do have said already many times - our socialism is bad and our government is evil. What can be said in response to such childish nonsense? Can we be truly evil, if we are only retaliating against misdeeds of others, if we are fighting for the greater good?! The answer is obvious - don’t question the means, end justifies everything."
BLR_blame_petrograd:0 "Blame the Petrograd"
BLR_blame_petrograd_desc:0 "The root of evil, the cancer at the throat, the iron beast which threatens to devour the last bastions of passion - that is what Petrograd actually is, or more specifically - the man at the top, who does all that rambling about \"Russia’s glory\" and \"Belarusian terrorists\"."
BLR_means_to_an_end:0 "Belarus, a Means to an End"
BLR_means_to_an_end_desc:0 "While Belarus may be our new motherland, and we have become a bit reluctantly supportive of its independence and the people’s pride, what matter more is the liberation of the biggest and the most oppressed by its own semi-feudal overlords country in Europe - Russia, which shall be brought to flame, its territory governed by our Socialist Revolutionaries."

BLR_actions_of_vituska:0 "Actions of Michał Vituška"
BLR_actions_of_vituska_desc:0 "Not to be underestimated, Vituška outsmarted everyone and crushed all attempts at opposition. He has a reputation of a radical and brigand, but his radicalism is not far-left - no, he despises the leftists with passion, - but far-right. It remains to be seen whether his actions will bring Belarus her lost glory and prosperity...or whether they will doom the country."
BLR_purge_old_clique:0 "Purge the Old Clique"
BLR_purge_old_clique_desc:0 "It is practical to hang a dozen, shoot a hundred and poison two-three most dangerous lackeys of the old regime to make a few thousand more submissive to your regime. No longer shall those decadents occupy their comfortable positions, as our state will dedicate itself to defending the Belarusian people against sinister councilists, mad accelerationists and deceiving capitalists."
BLR_black_cat_partisants:0 "Establish the Black Cat Partisans"
BLR_black_cat_partisants_desc:0 "While before it was simply an unofficial paramilitary secretly funded by Asobny Atrad’s more nationalistic members, from now on the Black Cats shall be our sword, our shield and our chainmail. Even if Belarus falls to the enemy, these partisans will continue the fight until the bitter end. Also, due to their weapons being of higher quality than those of simple infantrymen, we will improve our weapon production industry overall."

His brilliant speeches which excellently explained the more occult matters of his ideology to the layman helped him to gain public support, and with this support he raised an army of followers in the capital, who took over the government borough after Ataman’s disappearance. Now, Bogdanov stands triumphant, promising the crowd a new heroic age, in which Belarus will accelerate beyond time and space and create its own god.

belarus.1.desc:0 "While Stanisław Bułak-Bałachowicz is a despot, he didn’t easily forget the republican origins of his power. As a republican president and Ataman, he has summoned the representatives of army, air force, secret service, cabinet ministries and even a few official opposition politicians to discuss the Constitution of Belarus - a document neither ready for signing nor even complete as a printed document, for there existed a few drafts none of which were approved in time. After hours of debate, looking at his watch, our Ataman said-"
belarus.1.a:0 "Actually, you know what... let’s solve this issue later."

belarus.2.t:0 "Ataman’s Decision"
belarus.2.desc:0 "-Sir, we have the report you have commissioned finished.\nWith these words, an officer of Asobny Atrad walked into the heart of Ataman’s compound. Stanisław Bułak-Bałachowicz looked at the papers provided by agent and asked:\n-Estimated productivity loss as a result of purge?\n-No more than 1%, Your Excellency! - replied the officer.\nThinking about what to do, whether to choose security or mercy, old ruler of Belarus muttered:"
belarus.2.a:0 "Purge them!"
belarus.2.b:0 "Let’s limit this by scaring them a bit."

belarus.3.t:0 "What now?"
belarus.3.desc:0 "With a report by intelligence on his desk and a bottle of wine in his hand, Ataman was brooding. He was thinking about what to do now, after so many years of desperate governance, and after so many tiresome nights of managing the country which stood at the edge of doom. Suddenly, door to his room was opened, and a compound butler walked in, saying that there are two letters \"for His Excellency\" - one from Lastouski, detailing a proposal for meeting in Rada building concerning the unsolved constitutional debate, and one from Kostecki, a rather eccentric Polish-Belarusian officer who was engaged in writing popular science fiction books. Upon reading both letters, the Ataman said:"
belarus.3.a:0 "Oh, Kostecki’s inviting? Okay, send for the driver, we’re going to Albin’s restaurant at Brunon’s invitation."
belarus.3.b:0 "No time for Kostecki’s laziness. Probably, it’s time to discuss the Constitution properly."

belarus.4.t:0 "Constitutional Agreement"
belarus.4.desc:0 "It was a long night, and everyone was exhausted by endless arguing about the most trivial things in the constitutional project, but when the stenographer re-read the notes of constitutional conference, ataman understood that it actually went in the direction of a totally democratic constitution. Fixing his medals on the uniform, he coughed and addressed the crowd of future parliamentarians:\n-Dear colleagues. For thirteen years, I was leading Belarus. From now on, I resign due to a superior form of governance being borne in our mutual debates as their consequence."
belarus.4.a:0 "Cheers for democracy...I guess, gentlemen."

belarus.5.t:0 "Evening at Albin’s"
belarus.5.desc:0 "Limousine, imported via Poland from the United Kingdom, stood in the parking lot near a bit more modest cars belonging to the two rather resourceful Asobny Atrad operatives. All three cars belonged to people who were currently in a pompous restaurant located not far from the city centre of Minsk, all three persons were invited by a somewhat eccentric war veteran Eugeniusz Tinz, who currently was sitting together with his guests, waiting for tartar and beer to be served after a good serving of barszcz and roasted duck. \nBałachowicz, Tinz, Vituška and Savinkov were all sitting at that table, and discussing various things not concerning the matters of the state. After all, life was good enough even without all of that, and the very atmosphere of a peaceful cafe didn’t in any way force the four warriors of Belarus to worry about anything. Suddenly, Bułak-Bałachowicz noticed that the host was not at ease. Before he could do anything..."
belarus.5.a:0 "Tinz shoots the Ataman and stabs Savinkov."

Together, they sat in the car - not theirs, but in the Ataman’s limousine, and drove towards the government borough. When a guard tried to stop them at the checkpoint, they quickly bribed him and drove further. Upon disembarking, Tinz sent for his agent at the nearby telegraphy post, and told him to send a short message to Juliusz and to Dolgorukov: \"Phase One is complete.\"\nUnopposed, Eugeniusz and his assistant broke into the sealed headquarters room of Bułak-Bałachowicz. There, retired Polish officer sat in the Ataman’s chair, took a sheet and a pen, and said to himself before starting writing a letter:"

belarus.7.t:0 "The Pale Horse"
belarus.7.desc:0 "The Despot is dead, a scheming counterrevolutionary officer Tinz is dead too, and the reactionary coward has fled the scene already. Looking around himself, Boris Savinkov brushes away blood on his tuxedo and puts the revolver back in its holster. At last, with aid of his men and women in the secret intelligence of Belarusian Republic, he could be at the centre of power. Everything must be devoted to a single goal - revenge on Kolchak and his disgusting lapdogs, and triumph of the Socialist Revolution. The Spartacists may claim that the Revolution was false, that it didn’t go far enough - but they’re too blind to see the nature of evil that was plaguing Russia. Only with the Belarusians’ help, could the snake be cut into pieces. Only with the total and unconditional devotion both of the army, the people, and the nation’s dark knights, the Asobny Atrad, to the revolutionary cause, could the victory be secured. Savinkov looked at himself in the mirror and, being sure that nobody was watching, erupted in a diabolical laughter. Surely, he could be considered broke by everyone else, but how foolish his rivals will be proven to be."

Now, Vituška was just one step away from becoming the absolute dictator of Belarus. But would the public be informed of it? If yes, then surely the army and the police must be informed of it, preferably being led against possible protests by Vituška’s most trusted henchmen. If not, then..."

belarus.9.t:0 "An insignificant cult"
belarus.9.desc:0 "While it seemed that Vituška was victorious, and nobody would dare to oppose him, apparently the lack of information for public knowledge of the event led to some unforeseen results. Reports laid out to the new leader of Belarus indicated that amidst the rumors about Ataman’s sudden disappearance, in some of which it was speculated that Bułak-Bałachowicz got assassinated, a disturbing development occurred in the capital city itself. A middle-aged school teacher from Minsk, Aleksandr Bogdanov, has gathered a group of followers, from all kinds of backgrounds, who were swiftly organizing some sort of improvised cult, which disturbingly enough had some similarities in its ideology both with Zadruga and with the old Bolsheviks, albeit with a rather esoteric twist. Nevertheless, a brief report by the new dictator’s henchman indicated that the situation is more or less under control."

belarus.10.desc:0 "Situation is under control...or not? No, it is definitely not under control. \nIt seemed at first that confusion would continue for days or even weeks. However, in a vacuum of information, a sort of information virus could easily fill the space. In this case, what in any other country would be treated as a rather irrelevant circle of followers grew within less than a week into a fully constituted Accelerationist movement. These so-called \"God-Builders\" now had their press organ, their paramilitary, and their rabble-rousing agitators, which blamed Vituška for Bałachowicz’s death, while simultaneously urging the people of Minsk to strike. And, the craziest thing, the people did. They believed this mad prophet. And it seems that thousands of lunatics led by the Madman himself are going, armed to the teeth, towards the government district!"

However, both pay and more importantly the work security were much better than under the Ataman’s rule, whose bureaucrats were honestly indifferent to the common folk’s fate. Walking out of his house while going to work, Iazep wondered how clean the street was. It seemed that a newly established communal service was working properly - partly due to being overseen by a local municipal council, in which Iazep twice was present at the meeting and once even voted. Anyway, more people appeared not poor, more cars were on the streets, and the overall spirit was...blessed."

Finally, a belle epoque styled limousin arrived near the entrance to the corridor between the guard lines. From there, His Highness Uladzimir emerged, in luxurious Imperial robes styled on those worn normally by Romanov emperors at the coronation. It was later noted by international observers, that the whole coronation had undertones of some sort of farce, a carefully orchestrated show, a colonial imitation of a truly majestic coronations of antiquity.

While warriors of White Ruthenia resisted the Mongol invaders, Novgorod and Suzdal obediently paid their tribute. While in modern history Russia rejected its Tsars, Ruthenia remained true to its roots. But this shall not be another reason for the narrow-minded nationalists to preach their ungodly doctrine of supremacy!

You may not buy into the agitation of our party - c’mon, I’m not even sure whether our own recruits do that. What is simply required is that you do your job as defenders of Belarus on the invisible front.\nLeader of the Black Cats listened to Savinkov, and with each passing minute found this socialist, who was a rather charismatic man though, surprisingly agreeable.

What past, my dear brothers and sisters? Past of technological backwardness, past of oppression under a row of foreign masters? Humanity works this way - and our nation too - in the way of constant evolution, of constant progress. Those who try to fool you forget that there can be no return to the past. Those who insist on this foolery insinuate that progress implies breaking the ‘turn other cheek’ statement, as if a nation should obey these laws! Individual - surely, but a nation is an entity of a different caliber than a mere individual. If the present \"godly\" laws don’t fit the desired outcome - then we shall make our own God! When we are crushing the black hearts of our oppressors, we will find our hands blackened. We cannot cultivate our garden without digging in the dirt. And in this new Eden, seemingly established on the marshes and in the forests of our land of Nod, we will uphold our truth - a truth that shall deliver us from the fools of internal reaction and from the vultures of foreign oppression.

As copied into foreign newspapers, the speech was such: \n"Belarus can’t claim a title of being favored by whatever gods of the past were created in human imagination. Nonetheless, our spirituality always centered around a divine being, which however didn’t preserve any of our ancestors from being subjugated. However, with each defeat and conquest, our people haven’t perished - because from a more detached point of view, we were like the Lazarus of Abrahamic faith. ‘And he cried in a loud voice, ‘'Lazarus, come forth!'’ And Lazarus did arise from the grave’ - was said there. Even though that could be said if we separate the people from their blood-soken soil, which meanwhile draws another parallel - with that of Nod, thus making everyone here a Cain’s descendant. But let not the past frighten you - for the foreseeable future, comrades, I am the future, and the future I promise is the one in which the esoteric terror of our past shall be overthrown by the Belarusian collective will! No longer shall we stand aside as all progressive nations try making their own national Gods - be they named ‘ideology’, ‘creed’ or according to the most venerated personality. None of those spiritual according to their nation movements, none of those political religions are going to help our Motherland. However - if we create our own God, who will turn this Nod into Eden, who will be more bright than Elohim of the old scriptures and undeniably native to Belarus in spirit - then our victory will be assured. Yes, we live in such times and such lands - but it is in our power to awaken the masters of our future.""

I will not describe to you, colleagues, all over again, we do not have much time - but we have almost reached the point. \nA hoarse voice is accompanied by the sound of indistinct muttering from a gramophone \n... The fact of the existence of a special form of time and space described by the legendary academician Vernadsky has long been experimentally confirmed ... \nThe doctor quietly lowers the needle of the syringe, silently it pierces the parchment. Cold gray steel. \n... which he called the \"noosphere.\" Mr. Vernadsky described it as a sum ... - the voice pauses, - as a sum of all understandings, ideas, and thoughts known to mankind. \nThe syringe is quickly replaced by a system, a long bundle of orange rubber tubes, but before that one or more drops of crimson still have time to drip on the skin. So red they seem unrealistic. The Elohim frown. \n... We went further, colleagues. What if the noosphere - this treasury of humanity - is not just a closed room, but a platform for experiments? - the rustling of voices grows, merging with the noise of the gramophone. - Imagine the potential that opens before us, colleagues ... \nThe system is installed, and the crimson flows, shines, through the soulless rubber, filling with life all that plexus of tubes and vessels. Here is magic, the alchemical process of transformation and purification, precipitation and dissolution, filtration, and movement. The philosopher's stone of the soul, sealed in five liters of plasma and iron. \n... Humanity must play an active role in the noosphere, but - pause - the most important thing is that this role must be meaningful! No more suffering - we will erase them with the power of our mind, the power of our soul. No more evil - we will destroy the very notion of evil. And no more gods - we will become gods, colleagues, we will be able to create the True Absolute. Boundless. Comprehensive. - the noise of voices grows, and you can already hear screams. They accuse him of mysticism. How funny. \nThe Messiah smiles, watching the needles pierce his veins, and feels a pleasant chill and a light sparkle of blood. It's all a bit like love. \n... But for a perfect effect, we need something more than intangible thought or abstract ether. We need a real guide - a guide of the human soul. Blood, colleagues, blood is our elixir of eternal life. Mixing, distilling, purifying… \nOutside the window, the quiet rumble of cars and the whisper of leaves suddenly reaches an overcast intensity, and then the chandelier above his head explodes like a new sun. \n... we create God for ourselves… \nFive people, united by one circulatory system, watch the pulsating sun under the ceiling, and this sun pulsates in rhythm to the beat of their hearts. \n... collective self, ideal person… \nFive take an inaudible step forward, and dozens of others emerge from the fog - there is no more room, no more hospital, but boundless, boundless psychological workshop, where the proletarians of the new, Hemo-psychic era build their God, build themselves. Workers who have expectorated their lungs will live, Soldiers who have lost limbs on the battlefield will live. Women who died giving lives will live.

However, not everyone is content with his despotic rule, and some people don’t even hide it. \nFor instance, here are BSH and BNP, two parties whose main aim is establishment of a true democracy. The third party rarely mentioned in public discourse, but which has successfully infiltrated the Asobny Atrad, Belarusian secret service, is PSR, led by militant socialist Boris Savinkov. His grip over the organization is not absolute however, since another faction in Belarusian secret service, the Black Cats, is dominated by reactionary NNP, with its rather weird aims of returning Belarus to a pre-Commonwealth age. \nFinally, one shouldn’t underestimate the madmen - neither the sinister foreign cliques plotting their schemes in the shadows of rural mansions, nor a certain school teacher with a troubled, Bolshevik past - for all of them will try to achieve power, no matter the cost."
