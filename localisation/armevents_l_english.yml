ARM.1.title:0 "The Fragile Democracy"
ARM.1.desc:0 "Armenia sits at a fragile balance after decades of stability as a social-democracy, with an enormous skeleton in it's closet developing from an operation done in Azerbaijan decades ago, called Operation Diamond Knife which sought to colonize Azerbaijan and ensure Armenia would become a dominant power. Many people through the decades have tried to reveal our project in now-Centrocaspia, former Azerbaijan, as a genocidal, colonialist and vile project which only sought to harm races we do not like. We must ensure that things continue as usual, or chaos will take over the nation. However, a socialist dissident with no name entered Centrocaspia and tried to document what occurs inside, much like many others have tried. His fate is..."
ARM.1.a:0 "...The dissident disappears like smog in the night by the weapon of the policeman."
ARM.1.b:0 "He manages to waddle through security and publish his photos."
ARM.2.title:0 "Business as Usual"
ARM.2.desc:0 "At an emergency meeting of the Dashnak cabinet, one thing is clear: the investment into border security has payed off. A border patrol has caught socialist dissidents sneaking out of Centrocaspia with pictures depicting the… realities of the Armenian administration there. If these pictures would have leaked to the press, the resulting outcry would be catastrophic for the nascent democracy. The ministers pat themselves on the back for a job well done, briefly discuss steps to prevent this from happening again, and go home, seemingly content in life. The Prime Minister, Sirakn Tigranyan, while being outwardly identical to his comrades, is deeply disturbed. Even after he kisses his kids to bed and lies down with his wife in the deep dark of the cold Yerevan night, one question tugs incessantly at his mind. “What if someone else tries to sneak photos out of Centrocaspia? What if they succeed?” Eventually, he becomes too tired for even paranoia, and falls into a dreamless slumber."
ARM.2.a:0 "Secrets are only kept by constant vigilance, after all."
ARM.3.title:0 "1936 Armenian Elections"
ARM.3.desc:0 "As a... safety measure, we have decided to create a snap election to see who has the largest support base in our nascent and stable democracy, being either of the biggest parties - the Huntchakians, or the Dashnaks. Who shall win? So exciting!"
ARM.3.a:0 "The Dashnaks win! God bless our Democracy!"
ARM.3.b:0 "The Huntchakian Faction wins! May Armenia prosper as a Socialist nation!"
ARM.4.title:0 "Dashnak Victory!"
ARM.4.desc:0 "After the close call on the Centrocaspian border, politics quickly descended into the normal excitement before an election. While the Dashnaks, Huntchakians, and even the Tseghakronists campaigned with a grand fervor, in the end, the people had the final say. When the dust cleared at the polls, the result was for the most part unsurprising: the Armenian Revolutionary Federation has kept its majority in parliament. Prime Minister Sirakn Tigranyan gave a stirring speech to the parliament, stressing the importance of social programs, democracy, and the national and ethnic pride of Armenians. Garegin Nzdeh and his acolytes stormed out of the parliament when he began to speak, but his small but fanatical following is not a concern. Mikayel Varandian began to applaud politely after Sirakn finished his oratory, with the rest of the Huntchakians following shortly thereafter, indicating their support for the Dashnak plan. The future of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation appears brighter than ever before."
ARM.4.a:0 "Hooray for the Dashnaks! Hooray for Democracy! Hooray for Armenia!"
ARM.5.title:0 "Huntchakian Victory!"
ARM.5.desc:0 "The elections have consumed the minds of the voters as of late, and they descended to the polls en masse to give their opinion on the state of Armenia. In the end, the result was a surprise, but not a shock: The Social Democrat Hunchakian Party won a majority of the seats in parliament, usurping the Dashnaks, after a well fought campaign and gaining working class support. The new Prime Minister, Mikayel Varandian, gave a gripping oration to Parliament, stressing the need to protect the working class, defend democracy, and bring about economic and social equality in Armenia. Varandian’s predecessor, Sirakn Tigranyan, politely applauded after the conclusion of the address, and the subsequent applause of the rest of the Dashnaks is indicative of their tacit, if uneasy, support of the Hunchakian platform. Garegin Nzdeh and his Tseghakron prostlytes have refused to acknoloege the Social Democrat Hunchakian Party’s victory, and have, reportedly, moved into the mountains to live a “pure Armenian lifestyle uncorrupted by German puppet Takanks”. His supporters are barely missed, however, and a new day dawns for Armenia."
ARM.5.a:0 "The Clarion Call Echos True in Armenia!"
ARM.6.title:0 "Garegin Saves Armenia"
ARM.6.desc:0 "Panic has spread across the Armenian nation as what was once a simple conspiracy theory has become ironclad truth: the Armenian government has slaughtered the Azerbaijanis in Centrocaspia with an efficiency only capable in this modern age. As the photographs taken by socialist dissidents showcasing the horror of the undertaking spread across Armenia like a wildfire, so too does violence and strife. Yerevan has become unrecognizable, as clashes between various paramilitaries scar its avenues. While the assemblagists like the Dashnaks recriminate the blame and pontificate on the moral depravity of the actions ordered by their own government, the Tseghakronists have adopted a far more unified position: If it didn't happen, good, but if it did happen, even better. They have swung the Yerevan police to their side, and together they expelled the socialist and other anti-government militias from the city. Then, they marched on the parliament building, finding no real opposition from the military, which had become tiered of the petty squabbling of parliament. Garegin Nzdeh appeared before the National Assembly a triumphant man, demanding that they dissolve immediately and hand over power to him, so that he may root out the Socialists, the German pawns they are, with force."
ARM.6.a:0 "We accept. Hail Nzdeh! Hail Armenia!"
ARM.11.title:0 "Mass Internal Purges"
ARM.11.desc:0 "Garegin Nzdeh worked tirelessly after his ascension to power. For months, he labored in isolation from the public, leading some to fear (or celebrate) that he had fallen ill, or even had died. At last, however, he was done. *It* was done. He greatest contribution to Armenia, his only love, the state he would without hesitation give his life for and so far already had was done.\n It was not an easy task, creating a list of every prolific Takank in Armenia, but a necessary one. For Armenia to prosper, no, to *survive*, the degenerate subhumans, the *cancer* that were the Takanks needed to be destroyed. And nowhere was the cancer more concentrated than in Yerevan, the blessed heart of Armenia itself. All told, a fourth of the city needed to die. This was doable, however. It was like cleaning a house after decades of neglect, or tending to a garden left fallow for generations, but still doable. Nzdeh and the rest of the Tseghakron gathered up the Takanks and killed them. Men, women, children, all Takanks, all slaughtered. Some were hung from trees and churches, others burned alive, and still others were shot by roaming paramilitaries. Most, however, were rounded up and placed in front of anti-air guns. To say they were killed would be a disservice to the word. They were simply there one moment and, after a deafening roar, gone the next. Yerevan resounded with the sound of chocked gasps, screams, weeping, and artilllary. Amidst the horrific harmony, a single man began to smile, but stopped himself.\n After all, there were so many *more* that needed to die."
ARM.11.a:0 "I’ll do it for a thousand years if need be."
ARM.12.title:0 "Conscript all that are able"
ARM.12.desc:0 "As he observed a line, a thousand people long, of drilling Tsegh soldiers, Garegin Nzdeh felt proud. Why shouldn’t he? After all, he has not only ensured the protection of fair and sweet Armenia but guaranteed its growth into the future. As the roar of a thousand rifles echoes throughout the valley, Nzdeh saw something that made him stop in his tracks. An old woman, about 80 or so years old, was struggling to load her rifle and hold it steady. It warmed his heart to see such devotion. Oh, she would die. That much was certain, at least; war is not kind to the weak, the old, and the slow. In fact, Nzdeh doubted she would live past the first few minutes of battle- her heart would give out before she saw combat. But, was that not the greatest sacrifice? To give your life for Mayr Hayastan in glorious and just combat against her many foes? Observing the line again, he assessed the new recruits. By his estimation, only a third would survive the first battle. Deep in his heart, though he would never admit it, he began to envy the doomed.\n After all, martyrdom was the greatest honor one could win, and what cause is greater than that of beautiful Mayr Hayastan?"
ARM.12.a:0 "Truly we have made a place of virtue, a sole paradise on Earth."
