FCQ_fix_the_errors_of_1889_desc:0 "The 'Comissão verificadora de Poderes' is a government agency created on the aftermath of the 1889, being responsible to "verify" if the election of a candidate was legitimate, with the power to remove him if the comission wants to. For the last four decades such comission was responsible for keeping the sham democracy that poisoned Brazil, for locking the country on a never ending oligarchic dictatorship that lasted up until the civil war. As Salles policies seemed more lenient towards political dissidents over oligarchs, many members of the old class have judged him as another president they could exploit, and are awaiting to be bribed to ensure their loyalty, just waiting for a opportunity to betray him in the future. The time, however, had finally come, the time for a new age. According to the most recent proclamation published on the official government paper 'Diário Official', the Comissão Eleitoral will be abolished!"

FCQ_for_the_common_man_desc:0 "Welfare, education, health are still not considered human rights in Brazil, as Brazil didn't had a education ministry apart from a brief period during Deodoro's dictatorship, neither a health ministry or any kind of welfare measures. The government shall proceed to create such instalations in our provisional capital until we can relocate to Rio. While these ministries won't be able to do much with our small budget, we expect them to be the beginning of what we be one day a functioning welfare state."

FCQ_industrialize_the_maranho_area_desc:0 "Apart from Pará, Maranhão is also a underdeveloped state, with most of it's cities lacking the most basic plumber services, power plants, and even ports to better export our agricultural services.

The government plans to increase our farms output to reduce the price of the food and make it more available, while also allowing the starting up farmers who just received their new lands from old oligarchs to have a safe start on this new era. Some in the government claims that we do not have the money to pay everything we promise, but the problem will surely solve itself, right?"

FCQ_civic_identity:0 "Civic Identity"
FCQ_civic_identity_desc:0 "For years our governments have been drunk on foreign ideas of eugeny and of white superiority, being excludent with their own people, and some times even hostile. Our new republic on another hand understands that race must be a non factor on a ideal Brazil, and thus our people shall be considered not by their colour of skin, or family origin, but by their birth place, we are all brazilians, be native, white, black or asian, our diversity creates a huge diverse rainbow of colours that reflects the beauty of our people, and as such we must garantee that this new brazilian identity must be integrated on the hearts and minds of the people, even if we need to end racism with the force of arms."

First we must use the gains from all of our policies, be the guns produced on our own factories, the surplus manpower coming from our high popularity and the enthusiasm of our soldiers coming from our respectable and inclusive government to build our our armies. Let the oligarchs, would be dictators and corrupt politicians tremble, as our boots shall unify Brazil from the furtherst amazonian forrests to the plans of the centerwest, the cities of the southeast and the cliffs of the south."
FCQ_direction_west:0 "Direction West"
FCQ_direction_west_desc:0 "To the west we got three main adversaries, the first is the amazonains, rougly united under the activist Orlando Villas Boas, being a confederation of tribes, research teams, army units and regional oligarchs. Then we got the totalitarian city state of Manaus under the tyrant João Amazonas, the same who arrested our kind president Sales a few years prior. Finally we got the greatest symbol of the old republic, Marshall Rondon."
FCQ_direction_south:0 "Direction South"
FCQ_direction_south_desc:0 "South of us we have four main forces, the first being the cangaceiro lampião with his borderless bandit kingdom, a very dangerous messianic figure.  On the southwest we got the great, but sadly reactionary Marshall Rondon, the greatest military figure on recent brazilian history, but a diehard loyalist of 1889. further south we got the major obstacle, Filinto Strubing Müller, a oportunist who sided with the communists until and betrayed them on the last minute."

FCQ_destroy_oligarchic_elements_desc:0 "The unbearable stench of 1889, the putrefact breath of 1890, the rooting corpses of 1922, 1924, 1935 and the civil war comes from one single problem, something that poisoned the colony, the united kingdom, the empire and the republic: The regional oligarchies. A new extensive land reform program shall be formulated by the government to redistribute the lands of the former oligarchs between the poor population, while the voting rights shall be expanded and election monitors shall be assigned to prevent more rigged elections, it's time to fight fire with fire, especially against the people that branded our people with iron during the slavery era."

FCQ_direction_east_desc:0 "On the east we got three figures to face, first we got our new Floriano Peixoto, Goés Monteiro with his clique on Alagoas, maybe Sales greatest rival as he represented everything wrong the army has done since the republican coup. Under him we got General Aleixo and his allied politicians in bahia, a more sane figure. Finally we got Punaro Bley and his deliriuns of a "new old republic", a lackey of the government in Rio."

FCQ_industrialize_the_par_area_desc:0 "For decades the central government has ignored the northern regions of Brazil, since the empire era our economy was delegated to local agrarian oligarchs, making us dependent on the production of cattle, rubble, sugar cane, beans, sometimes rubber. The government shall grant funds to create a new industrial base through pará, starting from the Port of Belém through the tocantins and amazonas rivers. While a "miracle of the rhine" is unrealistic, and the project will be plagued with our lack of infraestruture and educated personal, we must remember that every single maraton starts with one single step."

FCQ_bolster_legitimacy_desc:0 "Our citizens now enjoy a higher standart of living and better opportunities than any other time in northern history, for many we are living a economical miracle as schools, roads and small consumer goods factories begin to show up on the main cities, while small clinics become common on the interior of the state and the increasing production of food allows a better distribution of resources through the state. While such economical gains increases the popularity of the new republic, the government pro democracy policies has also increased the people's political representation, we must expand these policies to garantee that the poorest person from the most isolated village have the same rights as the richest landowner on our capital."
FCQ_authentic_brazilian_nationalism:0 "Authentic Brazilian Nationalism"
FCQ_authentic_brazilian_nationalism_desc:0 "The USA is a federation because it was the union of 13 different colonies; Brazil is a federation because the dictator Deodoro copied the system. The USA is a republic because their new government didn't wanted to emulate the former one; brazil is a republic because our oligarchs wanted to copy the US form of government minus the democracy. The french elite is francophile because they were born in France; the brazilian elite is francophile because they visit Paris every year. For centuries our people has always copied what they saw outside, even our brazilian nationalists usually try to copy some of the fancy ideas they learned with the european radicals, and so we must break this precedent and formulate a true brazilian nationalism, a democratic and inclusive one, and garantee that creates a new generation hostile to foreign ideals, incompatible with our reality."
