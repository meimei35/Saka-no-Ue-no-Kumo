POLITICS_SA_ZHEN_BING_DESC:0 "“Sa Zhenbing supported us not because he knew much about socialism, but because he realized through decades of experience that only socialism could save China.”——Chen DuXiu\n\nIn 1859, Sa Zhenbing was born into a prominent family in Fuzhou. At the age of 13, he joined the BeiYang fleet as an apprentice .He became famous for his fighting prowess in the Sino-Japanese war of 1895.\n\nFor two decades after the fall of the Qing Dynasty, Sa had been an observer of the natural ups and downs of China. Relying on his identity as a national hero and the great influence of his family in local area, he slowly and steadily constructed his own political power in Fujian province. After the defeat of the northern expedition, Sa began to use his political resources to shelter the various socialists who fled to Fujian and invite them to join his alliance out of sympathy and national sentiment. When the time was right, he announced the establishment of Fujian commune that shocked the world. He was not only the leader of Chinese Leftist Association and Fujian commune, but also the patriarch of the "Sa Family", whose influence spread over Fujian's political, military and commercial arena.\n\nIn 1936, Sa Zhenbing was old and barely maintained the unity of the Fujian commune. Nearly ten years of running around, working day and night, so that this kind old man's body, gradually powerless. The increasingly intensified contradictions among socialists of all stripes, numerous brigades united by Sa's charisma, and even speculators who simply couldn't stand Zhang Jingjiang's tyranny... No one dared to imagine the future of Fujian if he died one day."
