fiume.1.t:0 "The Death of D'Annunzio"
fiume.1.desc:0 "This morning, Il Vate, Il Profeta, our Duce Gabriele D'Annunzio was found dead in his bedroom.\n\nOfficial autopsies believe the Duce died peacefully in his sleep at the venerable age of 74, suspecting no foul play. This news has been little comfort to some of the Duce's most ardent followers. Podestà Gigante, an old friend of the Duce, purportedly sought to rally the Arditi, believing that the monarchists in Italy had engineered the death of the beloved leader. A more rational response has been the quick organisation of the Consiglio Degli Otimi, an emergency council consisting of the most influencial members of the Fiume government and military. The first actions of the Council include the declaration of a period of mourning, followed by a longer period of celebration of the Duce's life and the ideology he took to such Olympian heights. A less communicated decree of the Council has been the mobilisation of the Arditi in an effort to curb both internal dissent and dissuade any of our many foes from taking advantage of this grand tradegy."

In response to this, the offer was extended to France, our closest friends and now, greatest allies. In response to the threat from the Italians, Fiume has decided to no longer stand alone, and now we have the power of the French backing us. The League Solar rises, and with it, a dawn for artists throughout Europe. "

fiume.4.desc:0 "Fiume is a place blooming with art. Ever since it's creation numerous poets, writers and philosophers found thier haven here thanks to our avant-garde approach to culture and atmosphere of extravagant self-expression. Every four years since 1924 these artists have a chance to show off thier skills in the grand poetry contest. After observing the various pieces by multiple writers, the clear winner is..."

fiume.5.t:0 "Addresing the slump"
fiume.5.desc:0 "1931 brought an incredible economic crash that destroyed with great chaos most of Europe's economies - and our city of vitality and joy was not an exception due to our profound ties to Italy. Due to this, We have been in an economic slump since those years, slowly recovering. But now, we need to act quickly if we are to develop in today's world and with D'Annunzio's health slowly waning, it means that other factions can slowly take power and place their approaches on the situation instead of D'Annunzio's neutral attitude. Marinetti suggests massive centrally directed labor force paid in food and housing, Shimoi believes that factory buy-ups and state acquisition of industry is a nescessity, and Keller believes that the best course of action is to ensure that the local syndicates have more power, in order to encourage local production, even at the expense of international trade."

fiume.6.desc:0 "In our glorious Republic we have long felt a clash, a violence against Slavs. Not our own Slavs mind you, those masters of trade, of strength and vitality, our Slavs are simply the best Slavs there are. However, on the border, beyond the Timave, beyond the Trieste, sits an ultranationalist regime that seeks to annex us and colonize us with superior numbers. We now feel like we must attack first if we are to maintain the security of our Regime, of our people, of our endless vitality and our spiritual strength. Their re-armament worries us immensely as they begin pumping out divisions with a violence unprecedented in this day and age, therefore various elements in Fiume have come forward and positioned themselves:"

fiume.7.desc:0 "The Arditi - Oh, our great forces which we salute with grand vital honor! You were visionary many decades ago, being the first troops of your kind, using only light equipment and subsequently entering trenches without the fear of death - They were also said to be the most feared corps by opposing armies. The task of Arditi units was not to clear the way for regular infantry to attack enemy lines, but to completely overrun enemy positions. The most daring volunteers were chosen, particularly those who were not bothered by loud incoming artillery fire close by. The men also studied fencing and were masters of hand-to-hand combat. Once ready, they were sent to the front armed with light assault weapons such as carbines, pistols, daggers and hand grenades. Many did not carry rifles and carbines because they would be cumbersome to fire in the confined spaces of a trench. The Arditi approached enemy trenches while they were being shelled by Italian artillery. Just as the barrage was lifted they would jump inside the trench while the enemy was huddling down, and use their daggers at close quarters to suppress enemy resistance. These primitive tactics were surprisingly effective. The Arditi stood in front of death with a pride never seen in Europe. Your motto was \"O La Vittoria, O Tutti Accopati\", and it still rings true today. Fortunately, we must adapt to the Future, and become once more the pioneers of the World, and therefore, we must choose what to do. How shall we improve our great and honorable Arditi? Shimoi, Marinetti, and Keller all have ideas, which they have presented forward to the Consiglio Degli Otimi..."

As our constitution states, in case of such emergency a dictator should be appointed. Consiglio Degli Otimi has arranged a meeting to discuss who sould be the succesor of our beloved Duce. The council decided to give emergency powers to Fiume's most influential figure..."

Monti, shining with its fountains and lace of shops-boutiques-restaurants, Prati, where the cream of society lives (their \"ivory towers\" are very fashionable but with taste), Testaccio, with its narrow streets and true Roman spirit, Trastevere - the bright flower of the art and beauty… there are dozens of them. They all cling to the historic center, to the vibrant city of Roman marble, the Catholic splendor of the cathedrals, and the golden memories of the Renaissance. The city of antiquity, the city of sweet afternoon sleep. \nNow your brood, oh lioness, is frozen in anticipation of the inevitable - like steel claws the columns of cars and armored vehicles penetrate your heart, agile and arrogant children of the New World. They race like a whirlwind, demolishing everything in their path, easily crushing barricades, jumping over intersections like a pack of street thugs. \nThe futuristic army has entered Rome and is greeted by the smoke of fires, the sounds of distant shots, the silent streets, and the colorful drawings on the walls. Although the Testaccio arose long before the first vehicles arrived, the futurists still had to make their way through the center with blood. Here the remnants of the besieged Italian troops fought with the bravery of the doomed. It was a wonderful, almost magical experience, but, nevertheless, the king was still able to escape. He was lucky, but you can`t say so about the whole royal district, which was turned into ruins. \nThe same fate awaits the Vatican - by the evening, fourteen batteries of beautiful, singing howitzers will begin the methodical destruction of St. Peter's Basilica and all surrounding areas. When the ashes settle, the rotten heart of the Catholic Church will stop beating."

Mighty bombers, like storm clouds, scatter their bombs like hail over the city, and with them comes the thunder of war and the lightning of battle. Futurists fall from the sky like rain - hundreds of paratroopers, young, brave, desperate, slowly descending directly into the heart of Rome. The Italian army is caught unawares - no amount of anti-aircraft weapons can stop such a huge shoal of celestial hunters, no land army can fight against an enemy that appears everywhere at the same time. With Arditic courage, the soldiers of Fiume storm the positions, chase, destroy and surround, and strike aircrafts hover over their heads like ravens, spreading panic, and taking away any opportunity to organize a defense. The Kingdom of Italy is no more - there is only Fiume everywhere, in flags and faces, on the radio and the walls of rebellious neighborhoods. The king flees, and his palace becomes the property of the newly organized communes and corporations of Rome, a true phalanster for all. The Vatican is facing a worse fate - the rotten heart of the Catholic religion, along with quarters of the decadent aristocracy, will burn in the flames of heaven.

And they do it - the well-honed swords of Shimoa, the futuristic warriors of Fiume, they make their way with fire, steel and fanatical, unearthly courage. Dense infantry columns penetrated the city from three directions, quickly cutting the defense of the Italians into isolated pockets. It is enough simply one click of the finger of the Shogun of Beauty, and each of these pockets will be washed away by a colorful sea of infantry. \nFanaticism is contagious because there is no other way to explain why blackshirts, who start rebellion even earlier, tie explosives to themselves and attack machine guns, why even civilians throw bottles of incendiary mixture and stones at defenders. \nThe flow of people sweeps away the vile apathetic, the slaves of the democratic regime, and all the sticky people who parasitize on the minds of the people. The king fled, leaving his riches at the mercy of the victors, and the church shrank in a bad anticipation - and not in vain. The Vatican will be destroyed - not by the weapons, because weapons are just an appendage to the Individual, but by the Individual himself.

fiume.10.desc:0 "Today, a charming pianist, Louise Baccara, arrived in our splendid city aboard the luxury liner Conte Verde, which runs constantly between Italy, Fiume, and the Far East. Her arrival is like the breath of the first spring wind in the middle of gloomy winter, and clear evidence that the city is expecting a new season of wonderful and impressive things. The star is met by her old cavalier, Il Vata himself. All this causes a wave of patriotic feelings, and unprecedented excitement in the city - even those who are not interested in music, want to see \"our Louise\" again. The languid carnival of Fiume erupts as if someone had thrown dynamite into an ammunition depot. \nD’Annunzio could not leave the goddess of Music without a suitable gift, and immediately upon arrival, the pianist received an extraordinary present - a piano made entirely of mother-of-pearl and ivory, as pure and beautiful as Musa di Fiume. \nBaccara will stay in the city for a month, and it will be a magical month - both for residents and for many journalists who are always looking for new scandalous material for their foreign tabloids."

fiume.11.t:0 "Antigone"
fiume.11.desc:0 "The spectators sit motionless, like a quiet evening sea, holding their breath, and only a silent whispers, like splashes, breaks the silence of the Palace of Music.\nAll attention is drawn to the stage, and the looks - enthusiastic and lustful, waiting and interested - are mixed with the light of dozens of spotlights, and everything around is bathed in golden fire.\nAfter all, where She appears, there is only light, and beauty, and unforgettable greatness of Music.\nThe most beloved star in the constellation of the City of Light, l'eterna amante of D'Annunzio, Baccara is in Fiume again!\nThis is how all the posters and newspapers shout, and the radio waves sing the hosannas to her skill and talent - Carnaro's favorite qualities.\nThey say a lot, but to say this is one thing - to see and hear different.\nPhilippe Bertoldi never liked the music so much, so even before the concert, he was more interested in his brand new felt suit not be crumpled by the crowd. After all, it's worth quite a lot of money, and he didn't spend it so that someone would spit or cough on his jacket now!\nTherefore, he had no idea what he would be dealing with when the pianist's miniature hands touched the piano keys and a wave of music swept through the hall.\nHe had never heard of such a thing. Philippe participates in the choir of their corporation (as well as almost everyone), but it was a completely different, hitherto unseen feeling. It was as if some nymph of music had invisibly hugged his shoulders and was whispering something softly in his ear. Philippe felt a lump in his throat, a small sun that was rising, rising, and suddenly tears came out of his eyes, and he had difficulty breathing. It's such a new feeling that he coughs - but no one pays attention to it, everyone is too absorbed in the magic of sound.\nSomeone hands him a handkerchief, and he smiles gratefully at the old-fashioned gentleman with the glasses. But the performance goes naturally, and now the scene is changing. Philippe did not notice when it happened, but now in the light of music flocks of kinetic ballerinas dancing,  and men and women in antique togas and dresses singing their arias. He does not remember the name of this play or opera - he lost the program - but listens carefully as if his life depends on it. The music goes so well with all this. In turn, the nymph smiles at him, and leads on…\nHere, when the city is saved from enemies, the piano plays joyfully and impressively, here, when the girl-heroine finds the body of her brother in hostile attire, it plays with sad solemnity.\nHere, strict grandfather-king denies her the right to bury her brother, and the musical accompaniment begins to cut like glass cut the heart.\nHere, she steals brother`s body at night, and Philippe feels anxious, as if he is there himself, in the dim light of the stage, dancing to the music.\nHere, she is caught - and the stern king passes his sentence, and with it reaches the culmination of the play…\nAnd the listeners can't stand it.\n-Hey, an old stump, leaves her alone!  -someone shouts and others support him with laughter, shouts, and relieved applause.\nEveryone seems to have forgotten that they are watching the play.\nThe old king did not raise an eyebrow but waved to his hoplites, who dive into the crowd to bring the daredevils to the stage.\nOf course, neither Philippe nor several thousand spectators are intimidated by this. With a thunderous roar, a human wave splashes onto the stage and spins everything - the actors, themselves, laughter, screaming, Philippe with a chair in his hands and an old-fashioned gentleman with the glasses, piano, and Louise, hoplites and ballerinas, dance and sound - all are becoming one huge, futuristic whirlwind of harmony. A thousand planets dancing around one piano like a parade of stars ... \nThey will carry Baccara in their arms all the way to the hotel."

fiume.12.desc:0 "Marinetti lit a cigarette and took a deep breath. The father of futurism, the steel duche of the electric future, stands alone on the bell tower of St. Vitus Cathedral. Extravagant and colorful as always - a banana-burning jacket, chic checkered trousers - he nevertheless still looks like just another shadow against the solemn twilight landscape of Fiume, dotted with carnival lights, distant songs, and strings of lanterns in the streets below.\nIn the dim light of a kerosene lamp, he resembles a metal statue that froze at the edge of the tower, examining his territories from a height. And only the light of a cigarette betrays a living person in this statue.\nThe father of Futurism watches the Palace of Music and silently marvels at its beauty. Behind the deceptive classic contours hides a truly futuristic spirit - Giacomo tried his best by painting the interior. Here and there the filling leaks out, creating a strange, strange effect that shocks passeisti so much. \"It's violence against art, how can…\"\n“It is possible, and it will be! The muse of culture needs a good beating! We will saddle it, and we will race into the future with the power of true futuristic machismo and rudeness!\"\nSomewhere far away, in the port, the lights flicker and the sounds of orchestras are heard - Fiume accompanies Louise Baccara in her departure. The famous pianist again leaves her magical prince, who is increasingly locked in the enchanting world of his palace, among roses, banners, and chocolate.\nMarinetti put out his cigarette.\nHe felt a little sorry for Gabriele, who was too weak, too soft during the romantic, sublime lying on the bed of Fiuman peace… but he approved of both his choice of music and his choice of women. For all her \"conservatism\", this pianist is endowed with a truly futuristic spirit.\nAnd her departure should be marked by a real futuristic spectacle.\n-Is everything ready, Umberto?\nUmberto Boccioni, biting a cigarette and holding a bulky phone on his lap, nodded.\n-Yes, we are ready. Agello has already taken off.\n-Good.\nAt that very moment, the Palace of Music was ignited by hundreds of searchlights, a bright mechanical construct, a motor the size of a city. Light shimmers on its surface as if it were not a simple building, but a structure made of pure diamonds.\nHigh above the luxurious roof, a colored plane hovers in the air, it glows like a lantern, and then almost clings to the roof, then takes off high under the clouds. The child of the future, ready to leap forward, he burns the desire to act, like the young spirit of the futurists, bound by a spectacle of beauty - charming, but frozen, like the Palace.\n-Three, two, one… Let's go!\nWith a thunderous roar, the Palace of Music shudders, as if from a heartbeat, and begins to slowly settle, collapsing as if in itself. Another explosion - and it turns into a bright ball of fire, splutters flames into the sky, engulfs a small and defenseless plane - just to make the machine fly out of hell a second later, as bright and shiny as before. Now all the searchlights are aimed at the sky, at the plane, which leaves behind the smoky ruins, and accelerates into the night sky…"

Until the workers arrived, it was possible to relax a little - it is unlikely that anyone will try to steal the suitcases of the Muse Fiume in the port, especially when he is nearby.\nThe liners in general, and Conte Verde in particular, have always fascinated Delfino with their machine perfection and grace. This is the most perfect of all types of ships, more complex even than the military cruisers, but much, much more beautiful. Each ship he always associated with one of the women he met once on the way of life. This liner was clearly like Bianca from Trieste - small and calm, but so sweet and with such beautiful green eyes. Maybe someday, when the Commander conquers Italy, he will return to Bianca and will design ocean liners - large, white, multi-tube… But for now - \"Hello, weapons!\"\nA rough scream, clearly in his direction, brings young Ardito from the dreamy half-sleep. A suspicious group of people, several strong guys in plainclothes and a man in carabinieri uniforms, shouting something and quickly approached.\nJust in case, Delfino hid an arditi blade in his sleeve. It is a pity that Paolo is not around ...\nThe carabinieri limped a little, as if he had once been kissed by the war, but struck the ardito with a rage unbelievable for such height. He waved his folder frantically and gestured rudely.\n-Hey you, kid! Yes, you, give me here the documents for the cargo! What do you say there? It was already been examined? But my documents - another round of dancing with a folder - says no! I have an order from the prefect! Give me the documents here, or I'll requisition the contraband! What? I don't care whose is those luggage, it is smuggling, and I take away everything. You don't have documents? No need to call anyone, I already understood everything! Guys, we requisition it all! Hey, step back, ki…\nDelfino grabbed the carabiner's hand, stopping this ballet of papers.\n-Nobody will take anything. The financial guard will come and judge us!\nThe carabiner blushed, pulling his hand out of his grip.\n-Oh, you son of a bitch! Guys, take-\nThe officer's eyes stared blankly at the hilt of the blade, which so suddenly stuck out his chest the next moment. With the same disbelieving look, he collapsed back like a puppet with trimmed strings.\nThe young men froze, clearly not expecting such a development, and Delfino raised his hand cautiously. Adrenaline pounded in his blood like steel hammers.\n-Don`t interfe...\nBefore he could finish, the loud bah-bah-bah sounded, and the steel painter casually slapped three red spots on Delfino's uniform. Ardito turned pale and fell on the cold pavement. He still had time to hear the stamping of feet, the screams, and sounds of the growing disturbance, before the darkness absorbed his sensations."

This time, some people justified the use of violence against officials who appeared to have exceeded their authority, while others condemned the psychopathic and inadequate nature of the Fiumans. But what was a distant newspaper chatter for most Italians was a pressing headache for the Minister, a clock running here and now. The Venetian events were a real clusterfuck of misunderstandings and unspoken, and the Minister once again reflected on the fact that the executive branch needs a total overhaul. The erroneously sent order was confusing and misunderstood - so the justification of the prefect sounded. Of course, this did not explain where the luggage, which according to the police report, she seized during the incident, went. The prefect only shrugged, the only thing he could do was to shrug and promise compensation. This oakhead will probably not stay in position long…\nBut that's not the end of the problem. The Fiuman adventurer spoke, and his mouth was Enrico Corradini. The respectable writer managed to distance himself from extremists in time of severe years of public unrest but maintained friendly personal ties with D’Annunzio. This proved especially invaluable in the absence of formal diplomacy between the two states.\nThat is why this morning Corradini bring a letter from the Commandante to the Government of the Kingdom of Italy, demanding to unconditionally admit Italy's guilt in what happened, to conduct an open investigation, to punish the entire city administration of Venice, and to pay compensation to the victims from Fiuman side.\nThe proposal has provoked heated debate among the government, with conservatives strongly opposed - we cannot set a precedent for powerlessness before D’Annunzio, while liberals are still inclined to accept demands to defuse tensions."

Our brave falcons, our life-loving young heroes became victims. Victims of a cemented, sleepy, rotten, rusty vehicle. This vehicle is called the Kingdom of Italy. Our beloved homeland, to which we so longed to return, continues to suffer under the oppression of capitalism, corruption, and demagoguery. Now this abomination has killed our children, our martyrs of the Spirit.\nThis is not just a crime. It's not just murder. It is an act of aggression, an act of open and unbridled aggression. This is another crime in a series of crimes, another step in this Crusade against Beauty, against all the Light and Pure in this world. This march will continue as long as Fiume exists, as long as it carries its torch through the darkness, as long as it heralds the beginning of the New World.\nDo you hear that sound?\"\n*distant noise of aircraft propellers*\n“This is how angels cry. On this day, everyone is in sorrow - even our magnificent nature is painfully affected by this blow. Do you feel this pain, citizens? Do you feel this anger, citizens?\n*chorus of distant voices*\n\"And I feel it too. Have I not been with you all these years, in sorrow and joy? Was I not your heart and soul?\"*chorus of approving voices*\n\"I promise you that this sacrifice will not be in vain. Our children will stand next to us on this fiery path to the future, on the path that will lead us to victory, on the path that will lead us to the Homeland as heroes, on the path that will lead us to the Divinely Beautiful World of the Future!\nThen, in the blazing rays of the Mediterranean sun, in the turquoise breeze of the Adriatic, we will destroy the rusty Machine of Italy. We will replace it with a new one. With a new one - aesthetic, sacred, and full of deep meaning! Are you ready to go with me into this future?

Each of them is as unique as their pilot. Each of them is an expression of the free spirit of freedom, the impulse of creativity - like their pilots. Pirate philosophers, poets-yogis, artists-scientists, and above all, free, completely free people. Guido Keller would not gather others in his team.\nThe legendary action secretary, the owner of a chic mustache and Arditic hair, sat in the lead plane, his favorite \"Ace of Hearts\", the beautiful Nieuport, painted in all possible shades of orange, red and yellow, as if it were not an airplane, but an angular piece of sun with the propeller. How beautiful he is, this plane, and how beautiful they all are, his young heroes!\nFrowning from the high, hot sun, Keller finished his coffee carefully and set the cup down on the makeshift personal sideboard. Then he adjusted his snow-white scarf, looked around at his wards and shouted at the radio at the top of his voice - the wind drowns out the words \"Hey, Ulfo, gain height, you're lagging! Theodata, turn north 300 degrees and sunset! Giovanni, read us poems!\"\nGiovanni Comisso, a cheerful and ever-smiling lover of peaches and sailboats, sang as loud as he could, filling the air with his verses, inspiring unexpected feelings and new, interesting emotions. They sail the blue sea of ​​heaven, listening about the blue clear waters of the Adriatic, and dive between the clouds like a yacht between the islands of Dalmatia.\nBelow, on the ground, the green squares of meadows and strips of the forest changed into a chaotic chessboard of suburbs, as the flying chaos came closer to its goal - to the glorious city of Rome. They are waiting for the mission entrusted to them by the Poet-Prophet.\nThen, before departure, the Aviator inspected his team again. They are all the celestial and spiritual elite of Fiume, which despises the petty conventions of bourgeois society even more than other citizens. One day they will lead Fiume forward like another high-speed plane, but for now, they are flying, dressed only in their impudence and an intense layer of body-paintings.\nCloser to the city, their formation disintegrates for a moment, unable to withstand emotions, and a uniform commotion begins, the nightmare of any flight instructor, when planes decorated with lotus and roses behave like foals in new meadows - playfully chasing each other and almost crashing in themselves.\nBut everything changes when Guido blows into his hunting horn, giving a signal to the colorful machines to stand in line and prepare for the attack.\nWhere did all the mischief disappear? One by one, the planes dive down, like colored shadows descending to the level of the houses and cathedrals of the Eternal City, and then fall their cargo on the heads of the crowd that poured on the streets of the city.\nSeveral tons of flowers fell on the heads of the stunned Romans. This event will flood the newspapers for the week.\nWithout encountering resistance, the fighters enter another circle, this time over poor areas, where people look at the sky with fear and disbelief, only to get a pack of chocolate on their heads. Not everyone is so lucky - there is not enough chocolate, although they have drained all of D’Annunzio’s supplies (Gabriele won’t mind). Nevertheless, those who have seen this surreal picture of candies tied up by red ribbons falling from the sky certainly will have something to discuss at home.\nThe final round, this time over the parliament building. Keller's plane descends quietly and smoothly, almost landing with all its weight on the expensive slate. One moment, and where he had just been, a donkey stared at the world from the roof with its sad black eyes, as he flew from Fiume to Rome in an action secretary plane.\nLeaving behind the commotion, chaos, and general confusion, Fiuman yogis return home singing…"

Why do they return?\n-How dare you run away from an honest duel! - Now Keller is really angry.\nBut his anger changes to surprise when a familiar voice is heard on the radio.\n\"Keller?

If they get to the benzine tank, Renzo will become a burning bullet.\nKeller is somewhere far away, and from the clippings on the radio, it seems that the squadron is not in the best condition.\nMaybe he can still change something. Maybe he can still save someone ...\nThe coordinated attack of the Italian fighters failed when one kellerista, pilot of already almost burning MAS in a spiral black and white camouflage, turned sharply into the thick of his foes. The pilots had to disperse, turn around their CR.32, so as to finally run like a flock on this stubborn leftover and drive it away.\nBut the spiral plane was not going to run away, tenaciously withstanding all the hits, losing parts and already actually falling apart.

POLITICS_GABRIELE_DESC:0 "Born March 12, 1863 the story of D’Annunzio is perhaps even more colorful than the country of the arts he now lords over. Enamoured by poetry and writing it himself at the age of sixteen, quickly becoming a lauded author of prose and text.\nNot content with just the literary world he entered the arena of politics, being elected to the chamber of deputies in 1897 and he immersed himself deeply into the richness of the human material world. Starting an affair with famed actress Eleonare Duse and living lavishly to the point that in 1910 he had to flee to France to escape a horde of spurned debtors, only for the Vatican to put his books on the Index of Forbidden Books for his involvement there in the musical play “The Martyrdom of St Sebastien.”\nThen the Great War came,  and with the excitement for the beautiful ideas that kill grew in Europe to gargantuan size, D’Annunzio returned to his homeland. Fiery speech after fiery speech praising the war effort, he took to the skies and became famous for dropping not bombs but propaganda leaflets on Vienna.\nThen the Great Gridlock happened, as the countries and orders of Europe reeled from devastation with no point and lives lost for nothing, their governments tried to stabilize the situation. Borders were redrawn, concessions made, bitter gall swallowed by all as they sat at a table with their great antagonists and tokens exchanged.\nOne of those tokens was the then italian city of Fiume, to be handed over to the croats, he marched onto it with 2,000 armed compatriots. First planning to have Italy re-annex the city, his hopes and heart was shattered with the thunder of boots that were the italian armed forces, encircling the city. Yet the newly proclaimed “Italian Regency of Carnaro” would not yield. Battered and broken in the war the italian army found itself beaten back.\nAlas as he and his growing number of men celebrated their triumph, D’Annunzio was lost in thought. For what was this transgression of the italian government if not a total betrayal of the country’s soul and greatness? The glorious Canis Lupus had not just had its jaw shattered in the war but its very spirit, with the corrupt oligarchs and treacherous liberals betraying them to british dominance.\nItaly would have to be saved from those that sought to break and enslave her not just physically but spiritually. He found both these liberations in the newly born ideology of Accelerationism. And so he fashioned the land he now ruled over into its image: a place of otherworldly art, of expression, of disgusting beauty and wonderful ugliness.\nWeaving poems aplenty, Fiume has become a shining light for the arts in the world, with many of their creators and appreciators flocking to it, the tales they told upon returning to their homelands serving like no other to promote the ideology around the world.\nAlas his greatest work, the liberation of his homeland still eludes him, and with his health failing rapidly, in his private moments he knows it always will.\nYet a man such as he, who lived such a colorful life and colored so many else's, won't go out with a whimper or even greyness. No, till his last moment he shall live a life of abundant color and poetry, oh so much poetry..."
POLITICS_MARINETTI_DESC:0 "Born December 22, 1876 Marinetti’s live story serves much as a parable for the contrasts of the ideology he adheres to. For despite seeing but limited success with his works, who could claim  to have helped birth an idea that within decades came to be one of the major ideologies that now vie for control of the world?\nEnchanted much like D’Annunzio enchanted by poetry at an early age he soon immersed himself into the world of prose, founding his own student newspaper at age 17, only to promptly clash with the establishment as he would so often through his life: threatened with expulsion upon bringing the then banned books of Émile Zombra to school.\nBeing sent to what is now Le Soleil to finish his education he soon switched his focus to the language of the new strange land. Soon being recognized by various poets one of which was Gabriele D’Annunzio and the two men proved to be of the same ilk, entering into a friendly rivalry with and influencing each other much in style, even if the love for the terrific and grotesque was to Marinetti’s liking alone.\nThen a profound accident happened. Always a lover for that which accelerates us and the sensation of speed he was pulled bearing minor injuries out of a ditch after having crashed his car. It was this incident he made a central pillar of his Manifesto of Futurism, claiming to have been reborn as he emerged unscathed from the violence and speed he had unleashed.\nAnd unleash much more his words would, the manifesto circulated widely throughout Europe. Espousing the ideas of militarism as cure for the world, glorifying violence, speed and contempt for women.\nWhilst Marinetti’s futurist inspired pieces of art in various forms saw limited success his ideas did and with the giants of Europe battering each other senseless with no real winner, soon futurism would influence much and become part of the burgeoning ideology of Accelerationism.\nMarinetti being cast adrift like much of Europe’s populace following the Great Gridlock he found himself soon a haven for his ideas: in 1919 he was welcomed by D’Annunzio warmly to Fiume. There he became one of the most influential men of the city, and with Accelerationism claiming more and more countries one of the most influential men of the twentieth century.\nNow following the death of his old friend and rival, Marinetti sits atop a grand workshop of human parts. Seeking to transform Fiume into one large machine of speed violence and war, endlessly charging forward as a wall of metal. And with one kick of the pedal the sluggish Kingdom of Italy shall be run over..."
POLITICS_KELLER_DESC:0 "Born February 6, 1892 Keller’s life story and character serves much as a parable for the eccentricity and rashness associated with the ideology he adheres to.\nFor Keller’s career as a deviant and outsider begins in his very childhood, despite being born in Milan to an aristocratic family he did not live up to the reverent and solemn expectations placed upon him, being expelled from his boarding school for indiscipline.\nThen the Great War arrived and there he truly spread his wings, both figuratively and literally. Becoming a rising star in the air force and earning command after command as the war progressed.\nThen the Great Gridlock came, and with it Keller’s wings were clipped as he fell to the ground like Icarus of legend. Yet as he fell through the sky he did not shatter on impact with the ground and instead fell into the gentle arms of Gabriel D’Annunzio. Being part of the host of soldiers that seized the city of Fiume in 1919. From there he quickly earned the old man’s trust and friendship, rising through the ranks like he did through the skies once.\nPiloting his plane into acts of piracy and theft to seize treasure for Fiume and strike fear into the hearts of her enemies. Stealing a pig only for it to break through the flooring of his plane, to him flying maneuvers in his pajamas, to after an exhausting flight resting under trees completely naked engrossed in a newspaper or book,  his plane always sporting a little tea set, flowers, cigarettes and tins of biscuits. Those were just some of behaviors considered by many eccentric and best and lunatic at worst he partook in his early years. \nIn the haze that was and is Fiume he truly spread his wings engrossing and revelling in the city states atmosphere and spirit of true freedom, romantic excess and danger more than any other of D’Annunzio’s other close confidantes.\nLike them he came to gather a following and finally a core group of like minded individuals around him, the “Yoga” group as they became to be known. Pledging to commit glorious feats of excess, dare and graze to glorify not just Fiume but the movement of Accelerationism as a whole.\nWhen the great poet passed on into the infinite skies, Keller was devastated beyond belief, crying for days and locking himself away in his room. His followers did not disperse however and silently battled in his name in the power struggle that subsequently erupted, not disappointing them he emerged again reborn and secured control over Fiume and D’Annunzio’s legacy. For all their genius he would allow neither Marinetti nor Shimoi to pervert the great legacy they had all inherited. No, he would commit all to maintain the wonderful experiments and riot of colors they had wrought together.\nNow secure in his position Keller oversees the statelet continuing on as it did during D’Annunzio’s reign, remaining a place of wonder and kosm of different ideas, not subjected to a single facet of Accelerationism. Slowly building up momentum as they charge the lost homeland. And with one mighty leap the unimaginative Kingdom of Italy shall be tackled to the ground..."
POLITICS_SHIMOI_DESC:0 "Born October 20, 1883 Shimoi’s live story serves much as a parable for the paradoxical nature of the ideology he adheres to. For despite being born on the other side of the world in Fukuoka, Japan, he chose to seek out a land alien and even much unheard of by his fellow countrymen. Not just engrossing himself in it’s culture, no he sought to elicit a wonderful and terrific synthesis of both the culture he had been born into and the one he had adopted.\nWishing to be a teacher early in life, he came into contact with italian language during his studies at the Tokyo University of Foreign Studies, quickly becoming enamoured with both the land and its tongue, going to Naples in 1915 in order to study the bearer of the Inferno, Dante Aligheri, and eventually becoming there a respected professor of the japanese language. Coming into contact with numerous intellectuals he became editor in chief for the magazine “La Diana” and finally introduced numerous japanese poets to the italian intelligenzia and public.\nLike so many of his contemporaries his life took a turn with the Great War, joining the Italian Army in their conquests. Rising through the ranks he became part of the “Ardito”, units composed of the most daring and perhaps foolhardy recruits, as their purpose was to breach enemy defences to make way for the bulk of the infantry. Despite their successes they could not turn the tide of battle and were dissolved by 1920.\nShimoi by then, disillusioned by the italian defeat in whitepeace, joined forces with one Gabriel D’Annunzio, first becoming acquainted with him in 1918. Making the trek to Fiume in 1920, where he was welcomed warmly in a great celebration. Introducing the martial art of judo to his fellow soldiers and eventually all of Italy, would see his star rise and eventually he became one of the three closest confidantes to D'Annunzio.\nYet, for all of Fiume’s glory in his quieter and darker moments he came to ponder the reasons for Italy’s  defeat in peace. For how could a country which had so miraculously unified itself mere sixty years ago fall prey to weakness and decay so quickly? For in the same timeframe his birth country of Japan had since the Meiji-Restoration seen a meteoric rise from laughingstock of the world to burgeoning world power.\nAfter much pondering the answer he found in each nation’s soul: the Kokutai. Unlike the Japanese who made it a very cornerstone of their political, military and civilian life, the Italians had disregarded their nation’s soul once they had reclaimed their nation’s flesh when they had finally fully unified. \nIn the wake of that revelation he urged for a new path for Fiume and finally Italy proper to take: one of utmost discipline and sacrifice, following the way of the warrior like the samurai of yore. Even if that way is found in death it would surely bring national renewal and strength to a once great nation.\nNow leader of Fiume, Shimoi oversees the creation of a pariah, the values of one culture being forcefully incorporated into another, creating a mutant that shall claw its way from hell and be able to best any foe in battle. And with one swing of the blade the disorderly Kingdom of Italy shall fall..."

Quickly, hard and effectively we will remove the infection from this beloved body - shock therapy by means of futurism has begun!"

FIU_Backward_to_Forward_desc:0 "Stop, oh, Racer! In your wild rush and adrenaline dash, you knocked an old and lost car to the sidelines. It's time to go back and restore it, and it doesn't matter what the price is! You have to give her back her old glory! Fill these tanks with carbon black gasoline, wipe these parts and lubricate them with oil, clean rust, and dirt from the noble contours, change the worn tires! We will put you on wheels again, O Italy, our sweet donna! Take us into your feminine embrace!"

FIU_Men_Are_Men_desc:0 "Futurists always remain futurists, and a man is a man. In the soul of each of us lives a fiery, invincible, explosive, all-burning urge to battle, to conquer, to the adrenaline of danger and the breath of fire! We are not afraid to shed blood - we literally suffocate from its excess!"

FIU_The_Lifeblood_of_the_New_World_desc:0 "A passion for success, a pioneering instinct for breaking records, the enthusiastic emulation of electricity and machines; essential conciseness and compactness; the sweet precision of machinery and of well-oiled thought; the harmony of energies converging in one victorious path - all this is possible only thanks to the priceless black liquid! We need to take it all! All I said!"

FIU_Another_Breather_desc:0 "Men have to recharge their nerves every day with reckless pride!… They have to stake their lives on a single throw of the dice, without keeping a close eye on the cheating croupier or the way the dice are running. Don't you see that it's a fundamental necessity for the soul to give the body a baptism of flame, to launch it like a fireship against the enemy, the eternal enemy who, if he doesn't exist already, we have to invent! ?… And that means - forward, forward again!"
FIU_Throw_Them_a_Bone:0 "Throw Them a Bone"
FIU_Throw_Them_a_Bone_desc:0 "Romania is a milking cow of Europe, a sleepy country of peasants and oxen, from which the power of this world take precious material for their little dishonest disputes. How about showing them their place? And at the same time, cook these fatty pieces of rotten meat, sleepy and stunned by the sounds of their own trumpets. All that is needed is someone to do one bad step."

FIU_A_Turn_Southwards_desc:0 "And the military Railroad of our State will be built. A spectacular Railroad, it will follow the highest mountain chains, and along which our fierce locomotives will soon be hurtling, bristling with shrill cries, away from one summit to the next, hurling themselves down the steepest gradients, then climbing up again in search of hungry chasms, of absurdly impossible bends, of impossibly zigzagging roads… All around, from far off, boundless hatred will mark our horizon, thick with the fleeing hordes which we will clean out into Hindustan!"
FIU_A_Sudden_Press_Conference:0 "A Sudden Press Conference"
FIU_A_Sudden_Press_Conference_desc:0 "We crossed the ruins of Europe out into Asia, scattering the terror-stricken hordes of Goutville and Paralysis far and wide, like a sower spreading seed with the wide sweep of his arm. At last, our gasping breath drove the sluggish clouds with their enfolding hostility before us, and on the horizon, we caught sight of the greenish dance of the Indian Ocean, upon which the sun placed a fantastic golden muzzle… It`s time for the final announcement, brace yourself, for it will be extremely thrilling!"
