nbe.1.title:0 "Birthday"
nbe.1.desc:0 "It was Corporal Albert's birthday. At least as far as he could remember the current date. In this blasted jungle every day, every week and every month were the same, they grew one into another like evergrowing tendrils of this green hell. They were everywhere. Breaking, cutting, burning could slow them down, but they continued to slither their way back in strangling the camp like thousends of snakes.\n Corporal look at his face in a shard of a mirror jammed into wall of his hut. He could barely recognise himself. The face belonged to an old man, not that of a youth he saw in the photograph among his documents. Would his familly recognise him? Would they want to? \n He considered for a moment shaving himself while staring into unkempt abomination of stringy hair caked in old sweat that covered his lower half of his face. He must been stinking to hight hell. He ddn't even smell it. Everything here stunk. The soldiers, the workers, the beds. Entire jugnle drawned in stench of death. There was no escaping it. They were all reeking of death and decay. Down to the very bones, to the very soul.\n 'It's time to unwrap your birthday gift, corporal.' He said emotionlessly reaching for his revolver. With a swift, almost mechanical motion he removed bullets from it and put back in only one. 'You were wating for it entire year, corporal. I know it's your favorite'.\n He continued staring into the old handgun before spinning the cillinder and cocking the hammer. With a heavy sigh he put the barrell against his temple. A drop of sweat ran from his forhead across his cheek as the hut was filled with dense, suffocating silence.\n After what seemed to be an eternity hammer hit with a quiet clang against the empty chamber. Albert feel to his knees sobbing."
nbe.1.a:0 "'God! You promised it will be the last year!'"
nbe.2.title:0 "Fall of Elisabethsville"
nbe.2.desc:0 "Burning mud of sunlight continued to drip slowly from the harsh, naked sky. Merciless rays while scorching ground and flesh alike didn't seem to disperse overwhelming shadows. Even at high noon everything drowned in sharp, black like dead man's blood shade. Shade that suffocated and strangled men and plants alike while offering no refuge from heat as if swarms of infinite flies buzzed at the meat of the carcas-state.\n Elisabethville was at the horizon. Or at least what was currently haphazardly build out of war-hollowed remains of it. City itself was a living corpse, a skeleton of brick and wood strung together with thick ropes of hopeless determination. Men and women lived there like scared rats right under eyes of an exterminator.\n But despite all they lived the best they could. A bored man in a patched hat tried to sell fresh fruits out of a stand. Woman admired herself in a broken mirror, spider web-like surface returning her dozens of brilliant smiles. Children chased after a kicked ball."
nbe.2.a:0 "None of them will live to see the sundown."
nbe.3.title:0 "I Feel As If Might Be Vanishing"
nbe.3.desc:0 "Lushiku remembered from his childhood an old white man, his grey beard reaching down to his sunken chest and strange black robes so unfit to the hot climate of the jungle. He remembered his voice, strangely melodic and enticing even if words coming out of his mouth were unpronounceable mess of foreign syllables. He spoke through a villager from another tribe who knew their native tongue rather poorly and most likely barely understood the white man in the first place. But he and others listened to his words anyway, some from curiosity, some counting on gifts he might be bearing, some to kill boredom.\n/Old man spoke of many things, many strange things. Of great god of his people, of his son and of their tribe in the skies. But also of a horrible place where the god cast those who he rejects. A place of darkness and fire, of torment and wickedness. A great furnace where unworthy are thrown to burn for all times for their crimes against him.\nLashiku, now himself an old man was there.\nHe did not remember now how long it was. A lifetime? Many lifetimes? A year? Time made no difference here. There was no Sun, no Moon and no Stars. There was no sky where the god of the old man lived. There was just the endless cave, the stale hot air and strikes of the tools against the stone. He experienced them working, he experienced them eating vile slop feed to him and he experienced them in his sleep. There was no refugee, there was no rest. There was no real light neither. Sun didn’t reach the cavernous depths of the Earth’s womb where they were stuck, only shaky, murky light of the flame brighten the way. In its hellish glow he could see his hands, like skeletal paws of a nightmare. The faces of his companions, sunken snouts of the dead men who keep on walking forced by leashes and chains.\n\nHe envied the dead and the blind.\nBut those who collapse, their husks spent to the last drop of blood. What happens to those? Do their spirits escape the torment? Do they return to the Sun and the Forest?\n\nHe didn’t believe so. Their torment was never-ending, there was no escape even in death. Those who fall only sink deeper into the endless maze of tunnels, the bowels of the monster brought in by the vengeful god. They were to strike the walls over and over again in hunger and exhaustion, in darkness and heat.\nVile speech of the monsters rang in his ears again as the lash hit his back. He must been slogging again..."
nbe.3.a:0 "Back to work."
nbe.4.title:0 "Camaraderie Without Size"
nbe.4.desc:0 "His name was Puk.\nWell, not really, this is how Cruel Masters called him. At first did not dare to speak his real name among them, then he didn't dare to speak it at all. Now he  wasn't even sure he could produce the sounds required to speak the word once serving as his name. But he didn't complain. Not just because he wasn't allowed to or didn't have anyone to complain to. He was someone. Born mangled and frail, maturing without growth... he was to be lowest among the low. Too weak to work, to small to fight. Ugly and despised.\nBut not for the Masters.\nThey took him, lifted him from the mud of his people and made him Puk.\nHe was feed scraps from Master's table. He wore clothes made by Them. He didn't work, he didn't fight. He just existed and that very fact was enough. Masters took strange joy in seeing him walk, try to climb furniture not fit for his size, wear clothes unfit for his body. He was amusing and that made Masters happy.\nOthers didn't made Them happy. They were lazy and ungrateful. They ate food they were given without giving praises, they bad-mouthed Masters behind their backs. This is why they were punished, this is why they suffered. Puk couldn't hide satisfaction seeing haughty giants broken under whips of the Masters. To see their perfect bodies bound and harnessed to do their bidding. To see those arms, those legs, those faces he was denied contorted into forced obedience to Those he was most loyal servant to. He, the lowly Puk might been but a lowly toad, a toy walking like a man but he too was like his Cruel Masters. He didn't dress like those working in the mines, he didn't walk like them, he didn't ate like them, he didn't talk like them. He knew words of Master's tongue, he knew their customs and their desires. When he followed one of Them around the camp prisoners looked at him with hatred of a cornered animal, he returned it with a look of a higher being he learned from his Masters. They were great teachers.\nToday he forced a boot way too big for his feet in front of one of the workers who fell from exhaustion. In a theatrical manner he demanded barely coucious man to kiss it. Masters laughed, their chests shaking and bright teeth flashing. And Puk laughed with them."

nbe.5.title:0 "Postman"
nbe.5.desc:0 "Lieutenant Claes opened a damp envelope with a rusty bayonet that served as his letter opener. He wasn’t getting any mail in years, much less one that could be described as anything “official”. This little piece of paper was brought in from the central command itself, supposedly identical copies were now on desks of commanders of local garrisons all over the Congo.\n“What in the devil could this mean?”\nHe asked empty space in the room, his only companion for most of his working hours. Emptiness didn’t break its habitual silence and gave no response. Letter was neatly written piece of typescript, something that he didn’t seen in close to a decade. But the contents were something he didn’t get in even longer: actual orders."
nbe.5.a:0 "Let's take a look."
nbe.6.title:0 "Orders"
nbe.6.desc:0 "Adam stared at the open door of the furnace filled with burning wood, his eyes sad and longing. Next to him was a half-rotten chest held together by wire and bent nails. It served him well for so long, his beloved coffer of wonders, his ark of the covenant. Piece after piece he removed little mementos from it and threw them into the fire. Photographs, keepsakes wrapped in old rags, notes. All one by one ended up in the flames making light dance on his warm face.\nOrders were clear. The colonists are to arrive. They can’t see any of this. They wouldn’t understand. No one would understand.\nHe looked for a while at one photo in particular, his eyes focused as if he was to see an old friend for the last time. Once he threw the photo into the fire he couldn’t bear watch it burn hiding face in his hands, bitter tears forming in his eyes."
