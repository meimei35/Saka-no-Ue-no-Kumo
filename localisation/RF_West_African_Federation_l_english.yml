waf.1.title:0 "1936 West African Elections"
waf.1.desc:0 "As promised by the British, the West African Federation will have free elections, and now they have come. All are welcome to vote, and thusly determine the future of the Federation. The Liberáls seek to enrich French and African culture under a classical liberal economy with welfare policies, and the Loyalists seek to strenghten relations with Britain and promote the English language. Who shall win?"
waf.1.a:0 "The Liberáls under Zinsou win the elections!"
waf.1.b:0 "The Loyalists under Cohen hold on!"
waf.1.c:0 "The Loyalists under Edward Akufo-Addo win the elections!"
waf.2.title:0 "The West African Civil War!"
waf.2.desc:0 "The Loyalists under Akufo-Addo have created an immense rift between the peoples of West Africa and people from all over the country have become immensely divided. A populist movement called the FLSN, the Front de la Salvation National, has slowly taken over the Federation as we barely hold on to the cities. Civil War has come."
waf.2.a:0 "Death to the enemies of the people against imperialism!"
waf.2.b:0 "Death to traitors to the Commonwealth!"
