Having been unanimously elected as president of the young republic by a gathering of political and military figures. A poet, philosopher and politician Muhammed Iqbal is essential for the young republic to run smoothly due to the large amount of support he gathers both from the general population as a beloved figure and poltical peers due to his work in creating the state. Iqbal wishes for Dinia to spread over what is known as Pakistan creating a true secular but islamic state for Dinia to thrive in.
